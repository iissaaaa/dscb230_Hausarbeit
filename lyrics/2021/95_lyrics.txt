I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

[Chorus]
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, "Man, what a beautiful sight"
Ain't a mornin' you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

[Verse 2]
And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, uh, well, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when
You might also like[Chorus]
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, "Man, what a beautiful sight"
Ain’t a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin’ out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

[Bridge]
The last time that I'd by a drink for a girl I'd never met before
I wasn’t looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, "Man, what a beautiful sight"
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday nightEmbed
