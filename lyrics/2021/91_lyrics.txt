I was no daddy's dream, was not your mama's prayer
But I was your first and your last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire when I smoked my Bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice, no good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin' life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' reckless, nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

[Verse 3]
I paint with my old Gibson, you paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby, let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars, chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

[Chorus]
This ain't for еverybody, toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you, it's a hell of a view
You might also like[Refrain]
A hell of a view

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
We ain't for everybody, toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby, this livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you, it's a hell of a view

[Outro]
A hell of a view
A hell of a view (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
A hell of a view1Embed
