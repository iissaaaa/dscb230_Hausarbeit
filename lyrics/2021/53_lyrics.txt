Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

[Verse 2]
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

[Verse 3]
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
You might also like[Verse 4]
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
[Chorus]
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

[Outro]
Oooh, ooh-hoo-hoo
