My buddy Brandon holds the record
For single-season touchdown throws
And good ol' Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like Cheers, they know him everywhere he goes

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
My buddy Jason, he's the sheriff
He'll flash his lights, but lеt me go
My boy Randy, he's a preachеr
My girl Megan, she's been teacher of the year
I swear for five years in a row

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Hamilton County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do
You might also like[Bridge: Kane Brown & Chris Young]
I got friends in high places, on these small town roads
'Cause 'round here, it's all about the people that you know

[Chorus: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
And I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Davidson County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

[Outro: Chris Young & Kane Brown]
(Ooh) Yeah, I do
Might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends, yeah
I've got some famous friends (I've got some famous friends)
