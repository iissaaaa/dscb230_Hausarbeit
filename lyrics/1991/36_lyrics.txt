You all want this party started, right?
You all want this party started quickly, right?
Play that beat, play that beat (Bang)
Play that beat, play that beat (Bang 'em)
Play that beat, play that beat (Bang)
Play that beat, play that beat (Bang 'em)
Go, go, here we go!
Go, go, here we go!
Go, go, here we go!
Ahh, Freedom!
Hit me!
Slam it, baby!

[Verse 1]
Enter the jam, the party is packed and I rap
Girls wall to wall, there's my man hangin' out at the back
So I cruise, slide up to the dance floor
I've never seen a club so hyped before
Get on the mic and get raw
Back to back, front to front, door to door
Everybody dance to the new sound, rock and roll
Soul to soul, I break it on down
From the bottom to the top, from the top to the bottom
Hmm.... I got 'em
People everywhere, they jump, they swing their hair
They shake their derriere, oh yeah
So loosen your body and let me take control
Let's rock and roll

Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
We're gonna rock and roll
We're gonna move your soul
We're gonna make you groove
Everybody move
Everybody move, yeah
Everybody move, yeah
Ahh, Freedom!

[Verse 2]
Whether you're into club or dance or rap or acid
Come on get with it, that's it
Throw your hands in the air, scream go! go! (GO!)
Rock and roll will go with flow, and yo
It will develop into a new form, break the norm
Get warm and then swarm, come back again
Give it up and transform, from BB King to Bo Diddly
Ed Sullivan - remember TV screens'd be seen
With the Beatles and the Jackson Five
The Who, The Doors, The Rolling Stones
And even I've dribbled a bit to get wit'
Helpin' the crew, that is legit
Your parents dissed it back in the days
The same way they diss rap, are you amazed?
So DJs, let's rock and roll
[Bridge]
Da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Dig that rock and roll
Rock plus funk and soul
Get on up and dance, yeah

[Chorus]
We're gonna rock and roll
We're gonna move your soul
We're gonna make you groove
Everybody move
Everybody move, yeah
Everybody move, yeah

[Break]
Get on up, get on up
Get on up, get on up, get on up and dance, yeah
Play that beat, play that beat (Bang)
Play that beat, play that beat (Bang 'em)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Ahh, Freedom!

[Verse 3]
On the dance floor, that's where we all get raw
Like a kid in a candy store
So get up, get out of your seat and arrive
Everybody, everybody up and get live
The C and C Music Factory
Is mastery and full of jams that has to be
Pumped 'til your ears get sore
Live from Brooklyn, out to the California sea shore
We came to rock and roll
To get on down with something funky with soul
Rob and Dave produced it and I juiced it
Spruced it, mass produced it and you proofed it
Party people, are you having a good time?
And singin' along with my rhyme
This goes out for the young and too the old
Let's rock and roll
[Post-Chorus]
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go (Let's rock and roll)
Here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go (Go ahead, baby)

[Chorus]
We're gonna rock and roll
We're gonna move your soul
We're gonna make you groove
Everybody move
Everybody move, yeah
Everybody move, yeah
(Go, go, here we go, go, go, here we go)
We're gonna rock and roll
We're gonna move your soul
We're gonna make a groove
Everybody move
Everybody move, yeah
Everybody move, yeah
(Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go)
We're gonna rock and roll
We're gonna move your soul
We're gonna make a groove
Everybody move
Everybody move, yeah
Everybody move, yeah
(Play that beat, play that beat, play that beat, play that beat)
Get on up and dance, yeah

[Outro]
Rock and roll to please your soul
Rock and roll to please your soul
Rock and roll to please your soul
Rock and roll to please your soul1Embed
