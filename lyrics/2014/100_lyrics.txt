Oh-oh, oh-oh
Hey
Oh, oh, mm

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, yeah
Are you listenin'?
Wonderin' where you've been
All my life
I just started livin'
Ooh, oh, baby
Are you listenin'? Oh-oh

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm cryin' out for you?
I'm scared, oh, so scared
But when you're near me, uh
I feel like I'm standin' with an army
Of men armed with weapons
Hey, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you

[Bridge]
I love lyin' next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what He was doin'
When He led me to you

[Chorus]
When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
And when you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you141Embed
