(Woo, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high, I touched the clouds
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife

[Verse 2]
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm never gonna look back, whoa
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now

[Chorus]
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
[Post-Chorus]
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
(Woo, ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
I hear it calling
Outside my window
I feel it in my soul (Soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (Control)

[Interlude]
(Woo, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
My li-i-i-i-i-i-ife
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be, this is gonna be
This has gotta be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
Everything is lookin' up
Everybody up now
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
(Woo, ooh-ooh)
