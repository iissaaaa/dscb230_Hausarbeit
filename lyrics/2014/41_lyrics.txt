Oh-oh, oh, oh, ah

[Verse 1: Jess Glynne]
We're a thousand miles from comfort
We have travelled land and sea
But as long as you are with me
There's no place I'd rather be
I would wait forever
Exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you
My heart continues to beat

[Pre-Chorus: Jess Glynne]
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

[Post-Chorus: Jess Glynne]
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be (Ooh, ooh)

We staked out on a mission
To find our inner peace
Make it everlasting
So nothing's incomplete
It's easy being with you
Sacred simplicity
As long as we're together
There's no place I'd rather be

[Pre-Chorus: Jess Glynne]
With every step we take, Kyoto to the bay
Strollin' so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries (Yeah)

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

[Post-Chorus: Jess Glynne]
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be, yeah
[Bridge: Jess Glynne]
Be
Ooh, ooh
Be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be, be
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah (Ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Jess Glynne]
If you gave me a chance, I would take it
It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be

[Post-Chorus: Jess Glynne]
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be (Be)
No, no, no, no, no, no place I'd rather be
No, no, no, no, no (No), no place I'd rather be
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be, yeah401Embed
