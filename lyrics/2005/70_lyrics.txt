Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes, the moment that I let you go
I just broke down (Down)

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice
'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me and roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me and roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby

Break it down now, I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you, its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, even if I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waitin' for you
I'll put it down, be the woman for you

[Verse 4]
I'm fallin' so deep for you, crazy over for you
I'm callin', callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true, no frontin'
It's you and no other, I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me and roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me and roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
[Breakdown]
Ooh-ooh
Crazy, lady, lately
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me and roll with me
I'm in love with you, babyEmbed
