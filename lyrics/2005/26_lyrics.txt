Aye
(I want a soldier) Well, you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' Impalas around
(I got a soldier) Wit' the top down, feelin' the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin', your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit' the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you, tell 'em "don't even try it"
To shoot it with 'Chelle, and kick it with Kelly, or holla at B
Ya gotta be Gs, you way outta your league
Please!

Open their mouth, their grill gleamin' (Gleamin')

A rude boy that's good to me, wit' street credibility

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street

Wit' that east coast slang that us country girls, we like

So quick to snatch up your Beyoncé (Your Beyoncé)
Always comin' down, poppin' our way (Our way)
Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Next to the speakers, keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D-boy used to run into traps
Still a soldier, go to war if you runnin' your trap
About my girls, ain't no thing to put ya under the map
Walk the streets, five-deep with nothin' less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 Gs in my jeans, plus the dough from the white
It's a reason I'm the king
Girl, I know what you like, c'mon

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]

That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street

Every time he look at me, my girls be like (Girls be like)
That one may be the one tonight

[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ay, see, Cash Money is a army
I'm walkin' with purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem, call him
Weezy F. baby, please say the 'baby'
If you don't see me on the block, I ain't tryna hide
I blend in wit' the hood, I'm camouflaged
Bandanna tied, so mami join my troop
Now every time she hear my name, she salute!
