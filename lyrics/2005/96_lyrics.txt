Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself, "We all lost touch"
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
Look what's over me

[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Verse 2]
Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
If it's a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
Bringing back
More than a memory
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Bridge]
You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Outro]
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)
(Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)
(Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)
(Chariot)
Give me your strength, oh chariot2Embed
