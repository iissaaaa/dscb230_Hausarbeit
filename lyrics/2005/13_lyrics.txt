No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart
Yeah
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

[Chorus: Fergie]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)

[Verse 1: will.i.am & Fergie]
Girl, you know you got me, got me (Yeah)
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
You can't stop me once I start it
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming, baby, don't doubt it
(Don't make me wait) So let's be about it

[Refrain: Fergie]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come with lustin', lustin'
'Cause I'll bring you that comfort
I ain’t only here 'cause I want your
Body, I want your mind too
Interestin', what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on, girl, yee-haw!
Come on

[Chorus: Fergie]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)

Would you still be in love, baby? (Love, love)
In love, baby (Love, love)

[Verse 3: will.i.am & Fergie]
Girl, you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you wit me
I'll play Bobby and you play Whitney (And I, I)
If you smoke I smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool
[Refrain: Fergie]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart

[Verse 4: will.i.am]

When you got passionate love, hurr?
