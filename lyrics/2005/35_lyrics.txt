I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
The feeling of belonging to your dreams
