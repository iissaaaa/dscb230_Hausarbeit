I always love a little mystery
But now the tensions killing me
No place left for words to hide
I never thought it could be quite so tough
Lips once sealed are splitting up
There ain't no secrets to outshine father time

[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights (Baby let's hit the lights)
Now I just got to spread the news

[Chorus 1]
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I don't have any ifs (Oh no)
I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (Wanna tell the whole world)
We're never gonna be alone (Alone)
Our love is stone (Hey)

[Verse 2]
Too many words are too much a crowd
I wanna spill 'em or they'll leak out
I'm so glad to get the chance
I kept it secret till I knew for sure
So not to pick my heart off the floor
Now it's time to take a stand
Heart in hand
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights (Baby let's hit the lights)
Now I just got to spread the new

[Chorus 2]
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (Wanna tell the whole world)
When I drop a tear (Oh yeah)
You are always here
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
(Wanna tell the whole wide world)
I'm look at a living dream (No way)
Don't wake me up

[Bridge]
Don't stop
Love me till you drop
It's alright with me
One sharp arrow through the heart
It's alright, it's alright
Now whistle

[Instrumental]

[Break]
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I will never give you up
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
You're my one and only love
[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights (Baby let's hit the lights)
Now I just got to spread the news

[Chorus 3]
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (Wanna tell the whole world)
I wanna tell everybody you're my cup of tea
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
(Wanna tell the whole wide world)
Your love never shakes (Oh yeah)
You don't alternate (Oh yeah)
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
(Wanna tell the whole world about my love)
Smoke gets in my eyes
I don't see other guys (Yeah)

[Outro]
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you (I will never give up)
Our love will never tumble down (Cause you are all ever wanted)
It's built on solid ground
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I don't have any ifs
I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about youEmbed
