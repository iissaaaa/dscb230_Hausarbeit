You know you want me
You want this

[Verse 1]
My girls goin' 'round talkin'
They say that you've been watchin' me, boy
I know by the way you're talking
That you're really tryin' to get to me, boy
Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this

[Chorus]
If you want my future
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
You want this

[Verse 2]
I know your whole story
Because you're fine and, and you know it
You think that you can have me
Just listen closely, oh, it's so easy
Every word you said, I have heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told, nothing else compares
To this loving body

[Chorus]
If you want my future
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
So you want my loving?
I know you want this
If you want my future
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
[Interlude]
You want this
Don't ya?
You want this
Say it

[Bridge]
You want this, you know it's true
You want this, you know it
You want this, you know it's true
You want this, you know it
Do you want this?
Do you want this?
Can you handle this?
Well, come here then

[Outro]
Early in the mornin' (You want this)
Late in the evening (You want this)
Just about around midnight (You want this)
'Cause you know I'll do you right, baby (You want this)
Oh, what's my name, boy? (You want this)
'Cause you got to say my name, boy (You want this)
Just a little bit louder now (You want this)
Just a little bit softer now (You want this)
I am nice and easy
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this5Embed
