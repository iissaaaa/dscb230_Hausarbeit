I don't wanna see you ever sad
Everything that I've got, you can have
When it's all too much, you need some human touch
To see it's really not so bad

[Verse 2]
Did you call on every saint you know
But still you feel like you're on your own?
Can you see through your tears I will always be here
And you're not out there, baby, all alone?

[Chorus]
Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight

[Verse 3]
Anything that hurts you hurts me, too
And I'm not gonna let your world turn blue
Will you take my hand and feel how close I am?
There ain't nothin' I won't do for you, come on, now

[Chorus]
Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger
Hold on to me, yeah, and I said
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight
You might also like[Bridge]
I know the world can drive you to your knees
But when you need to cry, baby, cry to me, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold on, 'til you feel a little stronger, yeah
Hold on to me, yeah, yeah, I said now
Hold on, everything's gonna be all right
Just hold on to me tonight, yeah

[Outro]
Just hold on to me tonightEmbed
