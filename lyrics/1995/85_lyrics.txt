Looking around the house
Hidden behind the window and the door
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home
Well, maybe I'm just too sure
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said

[Chorus]
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah
Good, good, good, good, good, good


[Verse 2]
Sitting around the house
Watching the sun trace the shadows on the floor
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home
Well, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter
Now maybe we'll see on the fourth of July
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud
Well I'm not sure, and I'm not too proud to say
You might also like[Chorus]
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah
So good
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Aha, it was good, living with you
Aha, it was good, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
Yeah, you were so good
Yeah, you were so good
(Yeah, that's right)2Embed
