[Verse 1: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgustin', so what does it mean? Damn it
You're kickin' me down, ah, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it
(Hoo! Hoo-hoo)
Peek in the shadow (Hoo-hoo)
I come into the light (Hee-hee)
You tell me I'm wrong (Hee-hee)
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls, but ah, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
(Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Hoo)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize (Ooh, lie, ooh, lie)
Somebody, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it
