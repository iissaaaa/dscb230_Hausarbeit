I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothin' to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father, and that means somethin' to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

[Chorus]
But love
I believe in love

[Verse 2]
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease

[Pre-Chorus]
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

[Chorus]
Without love
I believe in love

[Verse 3]
Without love, I wouldn't believe
In anythin' that lives and breathes
Without love, I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

[Pre-Chorus]
Without love, I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you and I wouldn't believe in me

[Chorus]
Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love1Embed
