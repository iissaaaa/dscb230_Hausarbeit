I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed for you to see

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)

[Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
(The lover speaks about the monsters)

[Verse 2]
I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire, despair, desire
So many monsters

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but now
(I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry)
You might also like[Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence

[Post-Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word

[Interlude]
(And people are being real crazy
But we will only come
And you know what, mommy?
Everybody was being real crazy
The monsters are crazy
There are monsters outside)

[Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me in silence

[Post-Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
Outside the words
[Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
The language is leaving me

[Post-Chorus]
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting outside the word
Outside the world3Embed
