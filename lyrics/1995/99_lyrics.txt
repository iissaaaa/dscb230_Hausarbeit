They say misery loves company
We could start a company and make misery

[Refrain]
Frustrated Incorporated

[Bridge]
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to see

[Chorus]
Put me out of my misery
I'd do it for you, would you do it for me
We will always be busy making misery

[Verse 2]
We could build a factory and make misery
We'll create the cure; we made the disease

[Refrain]
Frustrated Incorporated
Frustrated Incorporated

[Bridge]
Well I know just what you need
I might just have the thing
I know what you'd pay to feel
You might also like[Chorus]
Put me out of my misery
All you suicide kings and you drama queens
Forever after happily, making misery

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Did you satisfy your greed, get what you need
Was it only envy, so empty

[Outro]

(Put me out of my misery)
(I might just have the thing)
Frustrated Incorporated
(Put me out of my misery)
(I know just what you need)
