Oh, why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Cause I've seen the dark side too

[Pre-Chorus]
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothin' you confess, could make me love you less

[Chorus]
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

[Verse 2]
So if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing at the crossroads
Don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'Cause even if you're wrong

[Chorus]
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

[Chorus]
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you, I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Yeah
[Outro]
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
No, no, no, no, no
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you4Embed
