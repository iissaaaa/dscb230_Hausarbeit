[Verse 1: K-Ci]
Every time I close my eyes
I wake up feelin' so horny
I can't get you out of my mind
'Cause sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freekin' you is all I need

[Pre-Chorus: Jodeci & K-Ci]
Tonight, I need your body (I need your body)
Tonight, you got my time (Girl, whatever you want, I would give it, baby)
Tonight you won't be sorry (Yeah, ooh-wee)
Tonight, you got my mind (You got my mind, all I wanna do is freek you)

What must I say? (Oh, tell me)
What must I do? (What must I do?)
To show how much (Oh)
I think about freekin' you (Baby)
What must I say? (Tell me)
What must I do? (Yeah, yeah)
To show how much (Oh)
I think about freekin' you

[Verse 2: JoJo]
Oh, I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last 'cause I'm a freek
I hear everything you say
Turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freekin' you

[Pre-Chorus: Jodeci & JoJo]
Tonight, I need your body (Tonight, I need your body, baby)
Tonight, you got my time (Whatever you want, whatever you need)
Tonight, you won't be sorry (You won't be sorry, baby, baby, no, no, no)
Tonight, you got my mind (Whatever you want, baby, it will be fine, so fine)
[Chorus: Jodeci & JoJo]
What must I say? (Oh)
What must I do? (What must I do?)
To show how much (I think about freekin' you)
I think about freekin' you
What must I say? (Yeah, oh)
What must I do? (Yeah, woah)
To show how much
I think about freekin' you

[Interlude: DeVante Swing & K-Ci]
Freek out and freek me up and down (DeVante Swing)
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down

[Bridge: JoJo & K-Ci]
Every freekin' night and every freekin' day
I wanna freek you baby in every freekin' way

I wanna freek you, girl, your body's so freekin' tight
Every freekin' night and every freekin' day
I wanna freek you, baby, in every freekin' way
Every freekin' day, every freekin' night
I wanna freek you girl your body's so freekin' tight
[Chorus: Jodeci & K-Ci]

To show how much
