Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da
Ba ba da da

Take a look at our world, friend
And see the news at 10 o'clock (ba ba da da)
When I'm watchin' the world's trends
I never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

There's been some guys with some lassos
Visiting a mountain who's back broke
But someone else found true love again:
Hugh Hefner says he has three new girlfriends

And the networks now are so bold
That Snoop will probably get his own show
And I'm afraid I might tune in
Find Donald Trump and Rosie fightin' Hulk Hogan

I'm used to Ludacris but land sakes
Man, now there's filthy Justin Timberlake
And that Akon rap guy don't know what love is
You might also likeThere's kids developing a fan base
Meetin' total strangers out on MySpace
I know that's fun but if I had a new daughter or son
I would still not let 'em play with a gun

Take a look at our world, friend
And see the news at 10 o'clock (ba ba da da)
When I'm watchin' the world's trends
I never cease to get a shock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
Take a look at our world, friend
Even though you'll wanna gawk (ba ba da da)
Watch what's on your doorstep
You better go and get a lock (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)

There's been some wild scenes in Borat
And it's kinda hard to ignore that
But that Nativity movie they made it was well done
Though the girl that was playing the Virgin wasn't one

And I know you heard some bad talk
About those girls the Pussycat Dolls
But they're tryin' to fix the unemployment rate
By themselves, find some ladies they can train

I know DaVinci Code is jive, though
It seems as if America don't think so
If that you ain't up on that then go get plugged in
Ain't gonna read their family Bible
But I know they've seen the Family Guy though
And we've told 'em before
They oughta know there's a wolf pack at the door
They should be practicing the art of war, drawn swords, but
Nah, na, na, na, na, na

CHORUS

Girls gone-a wild and I think that most teens now
And dirty old men find it fun (I'm not one)
We've got guys who'll probably go to "Saw 5"
And say it wasn't even scary (Man, I'm serious)
We've got sources insistin' that sports is infested
With guys who cheat to try and grow strong (so prove 'em wrong)
We've got the crudest gags I've ever heard
I've seen comedians go a full hour (and not say a nice word)
And we could still perish any moment
And yet we joke about the future like it's Dave and Conan
Call me dumb, call me nuts, call me chump
So what, you'd better shout it
'Cause everyone is goin' to sleep and this is why I'm hot about it

2 Timothy 3:1-5
But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days
People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive
Disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love
Unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good
Treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God
Having a form of godliness but denying it's power
Have nothing to do with themEmbed
