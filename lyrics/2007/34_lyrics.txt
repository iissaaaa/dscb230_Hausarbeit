I'm back to my old ways
Got these bitches down on they knees like I'm holy
Okay, hurry babe I don't got all day
Only came to you to pass through like a hallway
I came to party like it's 1999 again
Crack a bottle invite a couple of ladies in
We probably won't remember everywhere we went
But we can take more shots than 50 yeah cause
I'm tryna see if you can keep up
Tell the bartender to bring a round of tequila
And look I know that you love me baby but I don't need ya
Only looking for pleasure, it's not a pleasure to meet ya
I said we ain't stoppin' til we see the sun
And my girl she just found out about my other one (ha)
Yeah, so I guess I gotta leave her
No Nickelodeon but that's two angry beavers

[Hook]
They only love me when I'm drinkin' (drinkin')
So when the night is, over
I'm hardly ever, sober
You know I'm back on my bullshit baby
Know I, know I, know I, know I, know I
B-back on my bullshit baby
(B-b-b-back on my bullshit baby)

Said I quit drinkin' but I'm back
Doing shows, signing tits, put my city on the map (whoa)
Goddamn I'm the man now
Did it on my own I never need a handout
Now they hate that
Blowin' all this money that I know that I'mma make back
Drinks stay chill the only thing about me relax
Word to Amy shit I'm never going to rehab
This girl, see to me she's a groupie
So I make this bitch pop, lock and drop it for Huey
She a woman to you, she get freaky for me
Started fuckin' with the kid, now she don't want to leave
I said, short dude but my dick tall
Like a ghost plus I'm the one she always call
I got the biddies in every city up on my balls
And they love to give it up like a round of applause (ow)

[Bridge]
They only love me when I'm drinkin' (drinkin', drinkin', drinkin')
They only love me when I'm drinkin' (drinkin', drinkin', drinkin')
B-back on my bullshit baby
B-back on my bullshit (bullshit, bullshit)
B-back on my bullshit baby
(B-b-back on my bullshit baby)
