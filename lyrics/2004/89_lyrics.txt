Sun tanned toes tickling the sand
Cold drink chilling in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Resting up for a long, long night

[Chorus]
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah

[Verse 2: Uncle Kracker]
All day long just takin' it easy
Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before
'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

[Instrumental Interlude]

This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
(When the sun goes down)
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Uncle Kracker]
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
She thinks Cracker's sexy when the sun goes down
[Outro: Kenny Chesney & Uncle Kracker]
Mh-mh-mh
We'll be feeling alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kennys' hotter when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, oh, we'll be grooving
When the sun sinks down, hey, Uncle Kenny
Over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes downEmbed
