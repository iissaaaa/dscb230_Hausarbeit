VÃ¡monos!

[Verse 1]
Save me from this prison
Lord, help me get away
'Cause only you can save me now from this misery
I've been lost in my own place, and I'm gettin' weary
How far is Heaven?
And I know that I need to change my ways of livin'
How far is Heaven?
Lord, can you tell me?

[Verse 2]
I've been locked up way too long in this crazy world
How far is Heaven?
And I just keep on prayin'
Lord, and just keep on livin'
How far is Heaven?
Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?
How far is Heaven? ('Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah)
How far is Heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)

[Bridge]
Tu que estas en alto cielo
Echame tu bendicion

'Cause I know there's a better place than this place I'm living
How far is Heaven?
So I just gotta have some faith and just keep on giving
How far is Heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)
How far is Heaven? ('Cause I just gotta know how far, yeah)
How far is Heaven? (Yeah, Lord, can you tell me?)
How far is Heaven? ('Cause I just gotta know how far)
I just wanna know how far4Embed
