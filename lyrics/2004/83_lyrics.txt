Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when

[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I done?
You seem to move on easy
You might also like[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Bridge]
I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

[Break]
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

[Chorus]
And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby26Embed
