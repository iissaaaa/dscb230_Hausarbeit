Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
The real me is a Southern girl
With her Levi's on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world, like I was Supergirl
The real me used to laugh all night
Lying in the grass, just talkin' 'bout love
But lately, I've been jaded
Life got so complicated

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh) I start thinkin' about it (Oh)
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what it feels like
But with you

[Chorus]
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothin' but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
With you, with you, with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Now that I'm with you

[Verse 2]
You speak and it's like a song
And just like that, all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh) 'Cause I start thinking about it (Oh)
I almost forgot what it was like
To know when love feels right
'Cause with you

[Chorus]
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothin' but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you
[Post-Chorus]
With you, with you, with you
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Come and take me
Love you, save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself
With you

[Chorus]
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothin' but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now (Baby, as I do now)
Now that I'm with you (Now that I'm with you)
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy (Crazy)
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground

[Outro]
With nothin' but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby, as I do now
Now that I'm with you2Embed
