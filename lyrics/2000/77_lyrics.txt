Ooh, ooh
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Ooh (Na-na-na), yeah, yeah
Ooh (Na-na-na)

[Verse 1]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you know, still, I miss you somehow?

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

"Baby," I said, "Please stay" (Stay)
"Give our love a chance for one more day, oh"
We could've worked things out (Taking time is what it's all about)
Taking time is what love's all about (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But you put a dart
Through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end

[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart (My broken heart)
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Bridge]
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still, I wish you were here now
[Chorus]
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two (A thing or two) I'd like you to know (You gotta know)
(You were my first love) You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
(You were my real love) You were my real love
I never knew love 'til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart

[Outro]
"Never look back," we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?2Embed
