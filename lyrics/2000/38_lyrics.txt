[Verse 1]
Hey, boy, don't you know

I've got an invitation
Don't you keep me waiting all night long (Mmm, yeah)
I know, you know (You know), so baby, don't (Uh, uh)
Pretend you won't (Pretend you won't)
Keep me guessin' if you, you will or you won't
Don't wanna play that game with you, baby
Said, listen to me

[Chorus]
(All I want is you) Come over here, baby
(All I want is you) You know you make me go crazy
(All I want is you) Now, baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't you wanna be the one tonight?
We could do exactly what you like
Don't you wanna be just you and me?
We could do what comes so naturally
I got a thing for you
Got my mind made up (Yeah)
And I'm serious, never been more, baby
I'm sure that it's real (So sure)
And it's right here, come on
Come on, come on, come on over

Come on, come on, come on over (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come on, come on, come on over
Come on, come on, come on (You give me)
What a girl feels, what a girl likes
What a girl needs, what a girl wants (Wants)
[Chorus]
All I, all I want is you
Whoa, baby
(All I want is you) Ooh, you make me go crazy, oh, whoa (Woo)
(All I want is you) Now, baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you

[Chorus]
(All I want is you) Oh, yeah, whoa
(All I want is you) You make me go crazy, you
(All I want is you) Now, baby, don't be shy
You better cross the line
I'm gonna love you right
'Cause all I want is you1Embed
