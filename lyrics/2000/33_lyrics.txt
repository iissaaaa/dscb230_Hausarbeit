Baby, set me free
From this misery
I can't take it no more
Since you ran away
Nothing's been the same
Don't know what I'm livin' for

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do

[Chorus]
Until you're back here, baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby, yeah
There's a feelin' inside
I want you to know
You are the one, and I can't let you go

[Verse 2]
So I told you lies
Even made you cry
Baby, I was so wrong
Girl, I promise you
Now my love is true
This is where my heart belongs
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do

[Chorus]
Until you're back here, baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby, yeah
There's a feelin' inside
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't let you go

[Bridge]
And I wonder (And I wonder)
Are you thinkin' of me?
'Cause I'm thinkin' of you
And I wonder (And I wonder)
Are you ever comin' back in my life?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause here I am, so alone
And there's nothin' in this world I can do...

[Chorus]
Until you're back here, baby
Miss you, want you, need you so
Until you're back here baby, yeah
There's a feelin' inside
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't...
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
There's a feelin' inside
I want you to know
You are the one and I can't...
[Outro]
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)
Until you're back here, baby (Until you're back here, baby)2Embed
