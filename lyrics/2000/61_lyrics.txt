I guess i was weak, couldn't even hide it
And so i surrendered, just to hear your voice

Don't know how many times i said i'm gonna live without you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something, baby you need to know
That deep inside me, i feel like i'm dying. i have to see you, it's all that i'm asking

(chorus)
Vida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live
The air that i breathe
Cari?o mio, my world's become so empty. the days are so cold and lonely
And each night i taste the purest of pain

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte. agonizando, muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuelveme mis fantasias, mis ganas de vivir la vida, devuelveme el aire
Cari?o mio, sin tin yo me siento vacio, las tardes son un laberinto, las noches
Me saben, a puro dolor

(chorus) (repeat chorus again softly)
Vida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live
The air that i breathe
Cari?o mio, my world's become so empty. the days are so cold and lonely
And each night i taste the purest of pain
You might also likeI'm sorry i didn't mean to call you but i couldn't fight it
I guess i was weak, couldn't even hide it
And so i surrendered just to hear your voiceEmbed
