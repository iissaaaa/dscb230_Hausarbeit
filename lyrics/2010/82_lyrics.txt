Yeah, 'cause what I got, you going to get some, uh, yeah
But girl, that's only if you ain't scared (Baby)

And I won't knock, won't ring no bells
You just float that bottom up in the air
Uh, I'll get you hot, I know you oh so well
And when I walk in, all that I wanna hear

[Chorus: Usher & Ladies]
Is you say, "Daddy's home, home for me"
And I know you've been waiting for this loving all day
You know your daddy's home and it's time to play, yeah
So you ain't got to give my loving away
So all my ladies, say, "Hey, hey, hey, daddy"
Hey, hey, hey, daddy
