Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber & Ludacris]
You know you love me, I know you care (Yo, uh-huh)
Just shout whenever and I'll be there (Yo, uh-huh)
You are my love, you are my heart (Yo, uh-huh)
And we will never, ever, ever be apart (Yo, uh-huh)
Are we an item? Girl, quit playin' (Yo, uh-huh)
We're just friends, what are you sayin'? (Yo, uh-huh)
Said, "There's another" and looked right in my eyes (Yo, uh-huh)
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like (Yo, uh-huh)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

Oh, for you, I would've done whatever (Yo, uh-huh)
And I just can't believe we ain't together (Yo, uh-huh)
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you (Yo, uh-huh)
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring (Yo, uh-huh)
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me (Yo, uh-huh)
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream (Yo, uh-huh)
I'm goin' down, down, down, down (Yo, uh-huh)
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around, and I'm like

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda) When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like baby, baby, baby, no
Like baby, baby, baby, oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
I'm gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Gone, gone, gone, gone), I'm gone72Embed
