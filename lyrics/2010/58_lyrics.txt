Ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

[Verse 1: apl.de.ap]
Cool, I spend my time just thinking
Thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to
Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up, it used to, used to be just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: apl.de.ap]
I spend my time just thinking, thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to
Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up yo, what's up, what's up

[Chorus: Fergie]
Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
(Oh, oh)
I can't go any further than this
(Oh, oh)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe and all the other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna meet
I navigate myself, myself to take me where you be

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
'Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown, town I travel downtown
Wanna have you around, 'round like every single day
I love you always, ways I'll meet you halfway

[Chorus: Fergie]
Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
(Oh, oh)
I can't go any further than this
(Oh, oh)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
(Oh, oh)
I can't go any further than this
(Oh, oh)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
[Bridge: Taboo]
Let's cross the bridge to the other side
Just you and I (Just you and I)
I will fly, fly the skies
For you and I (For you and I)
I will try until I die
For you and I (For you and I)
For, for, for you and I
For, for, for, for you and I
For, for you and I (For you and I)

[Breakdown: Fergie]
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?

[Chorus: Fergie]
Meet me halfway
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

[Post-Chorus: Fergie]
(Oh, oh)
I can't go any further than this
(Oh, oh)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
(Oh, oh)
I can't go any further than this
(Oh, oh)
I want you so bad, it's my only wish37Embed
