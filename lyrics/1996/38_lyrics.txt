Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yes
Oh, oh-oh, my, my

[Verse 1]
Here we are, face to face
With the memories that can't be erased
Although we need each other
Things have changed, it's not the same
Sometimes it makes me wonder
Where would I be if you hadn't discovered? (Where would I be?)
Which I did, inside of me
I know there was something that we could compare
Oh, well, I

[Chorus]
Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life
Uh, uh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Remembering the good times
From a portrait hung up high (Hangs so high)
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind
I made the choice and you couldn't decide
I made the choice, I was wrong, you were right
Deep down inside, I apologize
You might also like[Chorus]
Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life
Well, I never meant to cause you no pain (Oh-oh, yeah)
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life, hey

[Bridge]
Though I made plans with you
To always have time for you
Before you walk out of my life
I guess it's true
Cannot live without you
Don't ever go away
Ooh, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Never meant to cause you no pain (Baby, yeah)
I just wanna go back to being the same
Well, I only wanna make things right, baby
Before you walk out of my life, oh, yeah
Never meant to cause you no pain
I just wanna go back to being the same
(I wanna go back, I wanna go back, baby)
Well, I only wanna make things right (Yeah, yeah)
Before you walk out of my life (Out of my life, baby)
Never meant to cause you no pain (Baby, believe me)
I just wanna go back to being the same (Being, baby, yeah)
Well, I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life
Before you walk out of my life1Embed
