Some motherfucker gon' do today. Got shit to do. Got shit to do

[Verse One]
Now everybody used to tell me, "Go to school."
Down what I was doing and treat me like a fool
I've always been a cool cat even when I had no friends
You see I dreaded in the F and lived it up on the weekends
I wasn't freakin' them Thursday nights right
Had to get up in the mornin'
No time for night life
Full schedule of classes and work after that
Used to jerk on my dick cause I had no time to mack
I knew I couldn't be a college MC
Man, I want this world and acknowledgin me, and that starts today
Mark the way, I say my words in a text book
I can write an essay but if you gave me less than an A...
You weren't fuckin' with the way that I think
I'd rather travel the globe then study to be a shrink
Or a lawyer or a doctor, man that's proper but it's not me
I got to be, chillin' in my spot free of stress
I see the best road and I'm a take it
Make it easy to succeed cause I got something you need
Time to get my shit straight write my poems
No bustle in my hustle, just muscle in my dome
Foamin' at the mouth in front of mics for bein' hype
I used to say I was a rapper and they try to take me light
Weight/wait, I drop heavy shit
Always ever ready with the verse to kick in any situation
And bitch you tastin' delicacy
Man there no way else to call it
All it takes is time, money, love, friends, drive, gab, connections
Direction, focus, luck, skill, soul, style, image, sales and more mail

And now every day's a Saturday my friend
I go to sleep wake up and yo it's Saturday again
I say every day's a Saturday my friend
I go to sleep wake up and yo it's Saturday again
And now every day's a Saturday my friend
I go to sleep wake up and yo it's Saturday again
And now every day's a Saturday again
Now every day's a Saturday

[Verse Two]
(What do we do?)
We hit Hawaii in the winter
Who's payin' for my dinner?
Not sayin' I'm a skinner, man I'm fuckin' with the perks
Hate knowin' how it hurts to hit the snooze button twice
When you're probably late as hell and the air is cold as ice
Not even on-call man, it's a long haul to work
Traffic jams are gone and when all you can do is yawn
It's all for me, I'm nocturnal with this furlow
That means heat, I bring the knock when you sleep, peep
I'm only tryin' to have fun
If it weren't for my free time, it's safe to say I'd have none
And so I spit it like I got it
Relax, not off narcotics
And jotted down my raps instead of notes
Got it? Good
Get the other vibe, keep my love alive
I ride the rhythm not the bark from apart, it's society
People always tried to be freelancin' shit
But see, chances is, it won't happen if you're slackin'
Reactin'? No role, gotta slow your roll
Everyone can't do it
It was meant for me and I knew it
Never disillusioned Flexible and cruisin'
Day to day fusion my views in the music
And use it to jump to conclusions
Stump what's confusin' I'm awake while they snoozin'
[Hook]
I said every day's a Saturday my friend
I go to sleep wake up and yo it's Saturday again
And now every day's a Saturday, friend
I go to sleep wake up and yo it's Saturday again
I said every day's a Saturday buddy
I go to sleep wake up and I do somethin' nutty
I say every day's a Saturday
Every day's a Saturday
Every day's a Saturday
Now every day's a Saturday
