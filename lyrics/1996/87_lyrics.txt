There you are, lookin' at me
Tell me, what you want this to be
It could be everything that your heart desires
All you gotta do is stick around for a while

[Pre-Chorus: Keisha]
There's so many things that I wanna do
Take you all around, it's all up to you
If you take my hand and just follow me
There's no telling what we could be
Just you and me, yeah

[Chorus: Total, Keisha, Pam]
I don't need no one else but you
Tell me what you want me to do
(Tell me what you want me to do, ooh)
I don't need no one else but you (No one)
You gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true

[Verse 2: Pam]
Could you be all that I need?
Show me what I need to see
If it's alright with you, tell me now, baby
We can take this all the way, just tell me how
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Pam]
There's so many things that I wanna do
Take you all around, it's all up to you
If you take my hand, and just follow me
There's no telling what we can be, just you and me, mhm

[Chorus: Total, Pam]
I don't need no one else but you
(I don't need no one else)
Tell me what you want me to do
(Just tell me what you want me to do)
I don't need no one else but you (No one)
You gotta believe me, 'cause what I say is true

[Bridge: Kima]
If you wanna just take your time
I'll understand, just tell me why
If it's alright with you, I'll let you lead the way
No need to wait, baby, don't hesitate

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
For what it's worth I'ma keep bustin'
Keep puffin', and loving nothin'
If I die I'ma be high, no tears all of a sudden, bluffin'
Never finger on the lever selling records
In J. Boogie leather ready to wreck a nigga whenever
What I need is that scholar that could capitalize my dollar
Capital size, when it hit, it make me wanna holler
I do run run my mouthpiece with a vengeance
Start repenting if you didn't in the beginning
You should hit your knees, and do whatever pleases you
Long as you pleasing me, I'm all you need, nigga
The decoy watch Brat kill and destroy
You the last one to fuck with So So Def and Bad Boy
[Chorus: Total, Pam, Kima]
I don't need no one else but you
(Hey, no one else but you, baby)
You gotta believe me (Believe me), 'cause what I say is true (Oh)
I don't need no one else but you
(I don't need no one)
Tell me what you want me to do
(Baby, no one else but you) (What you want me to do?)
I don't need no one else but you (Yeah)
You gotta believe me (Believe me), 'cause what I say is true
(Hey, hey)

[Outro: Total, Pam]
I don't need no one, baby, as long as I have you (Baby)
You gotta believe me baby, 'cause what I say is true
(Believe me, baby; believe me, baby)
I don't need no one, baby (Oh), you're the only one for me
I don't need nobody else, baby, can't you see? (Can't you see? No)
I don't need no one else but you1Embed
