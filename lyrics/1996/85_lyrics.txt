[Chorus]
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul

[Verse 1]
Take me down, fill me up
Give me ecstasy, not enough
I am what you need, do it with me
In this world of hate, I can fill you up
I can clear the rain, I can be your dream
Baby, share it with me, I can make you scream
Baby, baby, baby
I can be your dream
You might also like[Chorus]
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul

Set you free
Set you free
Set you free
Set you free

[Verse 2]
Get it out, keep it up
Baby, feel it with me, loosen up
Make me feel the heat, give it to me
We can get there the same, tell me when to come
I can be there again, I can make you my friend
It will never end, I can be there again
Baby, baby, baby
I can make you scream

[Chorus]
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul

Do it to me now
Do it to me now
Do it to me now
Do it to me now
[Bridge]
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Express to me, if you feel ecstasy
This high is for you and me
Gravity, energy, make me feel good
So do it, and welcome to my planet soul
Planet, planet, planet soul
Planet, planet, planet soul
Planet, planet, planet soul

[Chorus]
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
Come into my planet soul
