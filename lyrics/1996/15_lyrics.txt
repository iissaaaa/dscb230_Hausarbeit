Did you see the sky? I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been

[Chorus]
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

[Verse 2]
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
Still, I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I'll swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone

[Chorus]
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far (Woo)

[Verse 3]
How you gonna ever find your place
Running in an artificial pace?
Are they gonna find us lying face-down in the sand?
So what the hell now? We've already been forever damned
You might also like[Chorus]
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far (Follow you down)
I'll follow you down, but not that far (Follow you down)
I'll follow you down, but not that far (Follow you down)Embed
