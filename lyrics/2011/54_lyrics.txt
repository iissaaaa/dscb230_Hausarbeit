When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Praying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go, don't, my love

[Verse: Vika Jigulina]
Can I get to your soul?
Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

[Pre-Chorus: Vika Jigulina & Edward Maya]
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

[Chorus: Edward Maya]
I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside

[Post-Chorus: Edward Maya]
I can fix all those lies
Oh, baby, babe, I run, love, I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you

Can I get to your soul?
Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real

[Pre-Chorus: Vika Jigulina & Edward Maya]
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you, baby, I just don't wanna let go

[Bridge: Vika Jigulina]
When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

[Chorus: Edward Maya]
I hate to see you cry, your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside
I hate to see you cry, my love is dying inside
I haven't seen you smiling, but I'm dying tonight

[Post-Chorus: Edward Maya]
I can fix all those lies
Oh, baby, babe, I run, love, I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
[Outro: Edward Maya]
Oh, baby, I'll try to make things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I18Embed
