Let's run away from these lies
Back to yesterday, safe tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sun creepin' up like tick tock
I'm tryna keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep runnin' from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me beggin', beggin'

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?
I don't know if you feel the way I do
If you leave, I'm gon' find you
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't

[Verse 2]
Baby, please don't run away
From my bed and start another day
Stay instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel the sun creepin' up like tick tock
I'm tryna keep you in my head, but if not
We'll just keep runnin' from tomorrow with our lips locked
Yeah, you got me beggin', beggin'

Baby, please don't go, go, go, go

[Bridge]
I stay runnin' from tomorrow
I stay runnin' from tomorrow
Well, I stay runnin' from tomorrow
Said, "I stay runnin' from tomorrow" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (Please don't go)
If I wake up tomorrow, will you still be here?

If you leave (I'm gon', I'm gon', I'm gonna find you)

Baby, please don't go, go, go, go (Don't leave me, leave me)
Baby, please don't go, go, go, go
Baby, please don't, baby, please don't
Baby, please don't run away10Embed
