You know I love music
And every time I hear something hot
It makes me wanna move
It makes me wanna have fun
But it's something about this joint right here
This joint right here
Its makes me wanna.... woo!

[Verse 1]
Let it go
Can't let this thing called love get away from you
Feel free right now, go do what you wantna do
Can't let nobody take it away, from you, from me, from we
No time for mopin' around, are you kidding?
And no time for negative vibes, 'cause I'm winning
It's been a long week, I put in my hardest
Gonna live my life, feels so good to get it right

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror (Mirror)
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it (Feel it)
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see, I wouldn't change my life
My life's just fine

[Verse 2]
Feels so good
When you're doin' all the things that you wanna do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
Keep your head up high
In yourself, believe in you, believe in me
Having a really good time, I'm not complaining (Hey)
And I'm a still wear a smile if it's raining (Oh, hey)
I got to enjoy myself regardless
I appreciate life, I'm so glad that it's fine

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror (Mirror)
Ain't worried about you and what you gonna do
I'm a lady, so I must stay classy (Mm)
Got to keep it hot, keep it together
If I want to get better
See, I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...
[Post-Chorus]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
See, I won't change my life
My life's just fine

[Bridge]
I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
(I ain't gone let nobody bring me down, no, no, no)
No matter what nobody has to say (No way, no way, no way)
(Oh) I ain't gon' let nothing get in my way
(I ain't gon' let nothing, I ain't gon' let nothing in my way)
No matter what nobody has to say
Feels so good, when you're doing all the things that you wanna do
Get the best out of life, treat yourself to something new
It's a really good thing to say
That I won't change my life, my life's just...

[Post-Chorus]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
See I won't change my life, my life's just fine

[Chorus]
So I like what I see when I'm looking at me
When I'm walking past the mirror (Mirror)
Don't stress through the night, at a time in my life
Ain't worried about if you feel it (Feel it)
Got my head on straight, I got my vibe right
I ain't gonna let you kill it
You see, I wouldn't change my life, my life's just...
[Outro]
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
Just fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, ooh
You see I wouldn't change my life, my life's just fine8Embed
