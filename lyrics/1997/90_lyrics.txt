One more time
Time
Time

[Chorus: Lisa Cork and Vanessa Mason]
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?

[Verse 1: Olaf "O-Jay" Jeglitza]
Twenty to seven
I will make you feel like heaven
I turn you upside down
I spin you round and round
I put a spell on you baby
I will make you come and play me
I'm gonna make you mine
Let's do it one more time

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa Cork and Vanessa Mason]
You spin me round and round and turn me upside down
You put a spell on me and hit me to the feeling

[Chorus: Lisa Cork and Vanessa Mason]
One more time, let's do it again
Show no shame, just call my name
One more time, again and again
Don't you want to play my game?
