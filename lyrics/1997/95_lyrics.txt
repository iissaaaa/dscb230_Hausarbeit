Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da

Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da

[Verse 1]
Hold onto love
That is what I do
Now that I've found you
And from above
Everything's stinking
They're not around you

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you
And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you
You might also like[Chorus]
But I miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby

Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da

[Verse 2]
Hold onto my hands
I feel I'm sinking
Sinking without you
And to my mind
Everything's stinking
Stinking without you

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the night
I could be helpless
I could be lonely
Sleeping without you
And in the day
Everything's complex
There's nothing simple
When I'm not around you
[Chorus]
And miss you when you're gone
That is what I do
Hey, baby
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew
Hey, baby

[Outro]
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Do-be-da, do-be-da
Hey, baby2Embed
