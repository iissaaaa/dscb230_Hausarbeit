Okay
(Let's do this dance)
Yeah, ayy, brr, ayy

[Verse]
Bia tu, banja
Roll up the ganja, don't be shy
Forget your manners, it's you and I, and I, and I
Don't pull out phones to post no stories
That's too corny
D-N-D 'til I D-Y-D the next morning
And we still zonin', please don’t
Yak, D'USSÉ
'Cause that's a hundred per bottle
Or three story posts from models
Give 'em a heart 'cause mine is hollow
No, oh no
I don't do no follows
You got jokes, Apollo
A mill in game like Gil and Wallo
Ain't no stressin' (What?)
You were at Fati's if you gettin' questioned
Don't block your blessings
Seein' stars in the presence of Kresnt
Ha, no sleep low-key
Oh, don't tease on the D-L, you a freak with a B-B-L
Salam khala, Aryana Sayeed
All good, Sayest
Mashallah at least
On God, Bismillah
A thousand ways to die, hazar rah's
Turn this up, where the Afghan kush at?
Burn it up, smokin' on George Bush pack
We don't know you here, you get bushwhacked
Buttons don't get pressed, they all push back
New deal, new deal, new deal, new deal, new deal
That's the price you pay when you too real (When you too real)
They don't ever ask how you feel
Don't play with fam that can get you killed
New price tag, we like that
Get knocked down, we fight back
It's like that
My face on every rice bag
Basmati, Jasmine
She wanna let a lad in
Ten out of ten, I'm smashin'
But who's asking?
We go on and on, Erykah Badu
Afghans love me more than Jadoo
With a chai tea and some gosh feel
Elephant in the room, see time heal
Grew up in choir, surrounded by bands
And the boy still on fire, man, you stand no chance
(My friend, he has no chance)
"Chunce," chants, I'm at it again
Bitch, I'm the man
Ball like Durant
Rap like the end of the month
I owe 'em some rent, a milly percent
I don't like to talk, I vent
Pray off the sins, repent
This ain't a trend
The closest of friends switch for a couple of cents, woo
