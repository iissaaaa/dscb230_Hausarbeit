You can hear them going crazy
In stadiums in every nation
A never ending celebration baby
This how we show our dedication

[Chorus: Jordan Knight]
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
We do it for the fans
The boys in the band
(hey)

[Verse 1: Jordan Knight, Donnie Wahlberg, Jonathan Knight, Joey McIntyre,& Danny Wood ]
Where the ladies? Let the crowd in
'Cause it's about to get loud in, here
And we're only getting started baby
Everybody wanna party with

[Chorus: Jordan Knight, Donnie Wahlberg, Jonathan Knight, Joey McIntyre,& Danny Wood]
The boys in the band
The boys in the band
We do it for the fans
The boys in the band

[Verse 2: Joey McIntyre]
And if it isn't love
Then why does no one vicious keep on showing up?
And why the boys from Boston keep on hanging tough?
Went from boys to men but we ain't ever growing up
Can't get enough
(hey)

Before we go Boyz II Men — To the End Of The Road
Let’s go back to the beginning
Pay respect — New Edition
Then came BBD, BSB, B2K, 1D
98 Degrees
Come And Talk To Me — Jodeci
From B Brown to Beantown
To H-Town to O-Town
Came the sound Berry Gordy found all the way back in Motown!
(Woooooo) — Had to catch my breath
Peace — LFO, Menudo, JLS, BTS
Westlife, Jackson 5, N’Sync, Take That
I Want You Back!
[Verse 4: Joey McIntyre]
And if it is enough
Then why does every generation have another one?
And why do all directions only lead to one?
Before you know it there'll be even more to come
You can't get enough
(whoa)

The boys in the band (all the continents)
