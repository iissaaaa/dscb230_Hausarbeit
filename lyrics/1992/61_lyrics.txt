You can just—
Walk on
Keep on
You can just go, walk on, keep on
You can just go, walk on, keep on

[Verse 1]
Sittin', waitin', anticipatin', waitin' for your call
Tossin', turnin', my heart's burnin' from the things I saw
I'm sorry, baby, you can't play me, I just can't be used
I'm so fed up, time to get up, baby, we are through

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood

[Chorus]
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just go)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (Keep on walkin')
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just go)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (We ain't talkin' no more)

[Verse 2]
I thought I told ya it was over, why are you confused?
You made your choice and now I'm voicin' my opinion to you
I think you're crazy to try to play me for a foolish girl
You'll soon discover you're not the only lover in this world
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I thought that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood

[Chorus]
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just go)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (Oh, baby)
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just go)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (Go on, baby, yeah, yeah)

[Post-Chorus]
You— You can just walk on
You— You can just keep on

[Bridge]
I thought that what we had would never end
Now it's too late, my heart won't mend
And although what we had was good
Got to make this understood
I know, I know, I know
I know it's just too late
I know, I know, I know
I know it's just too late
[Chorus]
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore (You can just—)
Keep on walkin', keep on walkin' (You can just go)

[Post-Chorus]
Walk on, keep on (You can just go)
Walk on, keep on

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (You can just go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (You can just go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (You can just go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (You can just go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (You can just go)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
