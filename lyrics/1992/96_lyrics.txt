I will be walking one day
Down a street far away
And see a face in the crowd and smile
Knowing how you made me laugh
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past
I will remember you

[Verse 2]
Look in my eyes while you're near
Tell me what's happening here
See that I don't want to say goodbye
Our love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember, I will remember you

[Bridge]
Later on
When this fire is an ember
Later on
When the night's not so tender
Given time
Though it's hard to remember, darlin'
I will be holding
I'll still be holding to you
I will remember you
You might also like[Verse 3]
So many years come and gone
And yet the memory is strong
One word we never could learn
Goodbye
True love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember you

[Outro]
So please remember
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember youEmbed
