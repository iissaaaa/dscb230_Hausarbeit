Well, you came in my life like a ray of light
Shining through the clouds in my heart
I just looked at you and the world was new
It was right right from the start

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh you came to me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh with a love so sweet
And I'll never never never be the same

[Chorus 1:]
Everything changes
Nothing looks the same through the eyes of love
Everything changes (Everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes

[Verse 2:]
Thought there never would be anyone for me
Then you came and changed everything
Now I shine like new because I've got you
Oh, ain't love a wonderful thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh you took my blues
Whoa, oh, oh, oh made them yesterday's news
And I'll never, never ever be the same
You might also like[Chorus 2:]
Everything changes
Nothing looks the same through the eyes of love
Everything changes (Everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
Standing in the light of a bright new sun
Everything changes (Everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes

[Bridge:]
I'm looking around me
And I'm loving what I see
Cause I found somebody somebody who loves me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Whoa, oh, oh, oh you came to me
Whoa, oh, oh, oh with a love so sweet
And I'll never never never be the same

[Chorus 3:]
Everything changes
Nothing looks the same through the eyes of love
Everything changes (Everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
Standing in the light of a bright new sun

Everything changes, oh, oh, oh
Standing in the light of a bright new sun
Everything changes (Everything changes)
When you love some, love some, love someone
Everything changes
