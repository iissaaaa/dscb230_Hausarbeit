We got a— we got a love, we got a— we got a love
We got a— we got a love, we got a— we got a love
We got a— just how a love should be

[Verse 1]
Can't stand it when you're away
Without a doubt you're the best thing that's happened to me
Yeah, baby
And I just can't wait to have you by my side
You know whenever you're around, a smile is all that you're gonna see
Ohh
'Cause you make me feel so good inside
And there is no doubt, yeah, I'm satisfied
I know that I won't find a better love
I've got a love that other girls dream of, hey, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy

[Chorus]
We got a love thang (Love thang)
Feels so good to me (Feels so good to me)
This is our thang (Our thang)
Just how a love should be (Don't you know that's just how a love should be? Oh)
We got a— we got a love, we got a— we got a love
We got a— just how a love should be

I used to be lonely, yeah
'Cause I couldn't find someone that I could call my own
No, no
Suddenly you stepped in my life
Now you're here with me and all my lonely days are gone
They are gone, oh, no
I don't know if it's wrong or right
But it's better than the lonely nights
I know that I won't find a better love
I've got a love that other girls dream of, hey, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy

[Chorus]
We got a love thang (Love thang)
Feels so good to me (Feels so good to me)
This is our thang (Our thang)
Just how a love should be (Don't you know that's just how a love should be?)
