Nothing's so loud
As hearing when we lie
Truth is not kind
And you've said neither am I

[Pre-Chorus]
And the air outside, so soft
Is saying everything
Everything

[Chorus]
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, feel it say

[Verse 2]
Nothing's so cold
As closing the heart when all we need
Is to free the soul
But we wouldn't be that brave, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And the air outside, so soft
Confessing everything
Everything
You might also like[Chorus]
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, feel it say

[Bridge]
And it won't matter now
Whatever happens will be
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be
It won't trouble me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
All I want is to feel this way
To be this close, feel the same
All I want is to feel this way
The evening speaks, feel it say

[Outro]
And it feels so close (All I want is to feel this way)
Let it take me in (Be this close, feel the same)
Let it hold me so (All I want is to feel this way)
I can feel it say (Evening speaks, feel it say)3Embed
