Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again
It's a game I just can't win
There you are breathing soft on my skin, yeah
Still you won't let me in, so come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby, let the moment take your heart away

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

[Verse 2]
And you're the girl I got to have
I got to have you baby, yeah, oh, come on
There you go, midnight promises again, yeah
But they're broken by the dawn
You want to go further, faster everyday, baby
But in the morning you'll be gone and I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Why save your kisses for a rainy day
Baby, let the moment take your heart away
You might also like[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Every dream I dream is like
Some kinda rash and reckless scene
To give out such crazy love
You must be some kind of drug
And if my time don't ever come
For me you're still the one
Damned if I don't, damned if I do
I got to get a fix on you

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apart
Have you ever needed someone so bad

[Bridge]
And you're the girl, I got to have
I got to have you baby, yeah
It's a game I just can't win, oh
[Outro]
Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah
Have you ever wanted someone
(Have you ever wanted someone, you just couldn't have)
Did you ever try so hard that your world just fell apartEmbed
