If you got the fattest ass on the block, now drop
Let a nigga see the coochie pop, now drop
Do the snake, do the freak, do the whop, now drop
Yo don't stop, don't stop
Real eyes down south thighs, now drop
Waist line, five six seven, now drop
One time all in together, now drop
Yo, don't stop, don't stop

Up in the club
Forget VIP
"P" to the "I", "I" to the "T"
Ying to the Yang
Up in this thang
D to the Roc
My dawg Kaine
Up in the cut, pourin' it up
Rollin' it up, holdin' it up
Ain't that thing swollen or what?
Yes sir, yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That makes me 2 live for your crew
Oh, get down, get low
I'm crossing these mammas like Tic-Tac-Toe
Let's ride, let's go
Get loose, get crunk, get drunk, get blowed
That's right, lets roll
MIA ATL fo' sho'

All the lil' mamas all around the world
Shake that thang if you a nasty girl
Back that thang up, says Juvenile
Show a nigga some tities like girls gone wild
Take off your dancing clothes, I wanna see u in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down the yellow brick road
Where brothers go to see her come out they clothes
Shake that thang girl
And be off in the club, lookin' hard
Drop like this (drop like this)
If you wanna make the money, shawty work that (work that)
Put a hump in your back and lift you wrong
To a 3 point stance, with yo' flexible self
You must be on that Kanye work out plan
Like head, shoulders, knees, toes
If you got the fattest ass on the block, now drop

All my shadow people, freaky where you at
All my broadway people, freaky where you at
Where my fellas in the back with the carnie act
Where my girls who think they got it like that
All my independent women, freaky where you at
All my get money dogs, freaky where you at
Where my girls with the thongs that shakin' it fast
If you love to sing along, nigga holla back

Bend over, bend over, bend over, bend over, bend over, bend over
Now Drop!
C'mon, c'mon, now drop!
C'mon, c'mon, now drop!
C'mon, c'mon, now drop!
What, what, what, now drop, drop, drop!
