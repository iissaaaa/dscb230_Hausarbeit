Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, let's go there
Take me to that great place
With wonders and wishes
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, you know where
Just take me to that great place

[Verse 1: Mýa]
Sittin' here thinking about yesterday
About what we did and how we used to play
Just the thought of you brings a smile upon my face
That's how it makes me feel to see you everyday, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Mya & Blackstreet, Mya]
Where we go, nobody knows
And what we do is between me and you
So come on and take my hand, to that special place
Where smiles come to life and dreams come true, ooh

[Chorus: Mýa & Blackstreet]
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, let's go there
Take me to that great place
With wonders and wishes
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, you know where
Just take me to that great place

Cause you know that everything will be alright
I see the magic in your eyes
Strong enough you know to bring your dreams to life, whoa, yeah

[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Angelica the one with all the exposure
Dil is the one they drive in the stroller
And Tommy got the whole world on his shoulders
While Dil cried to sleep till his eyes are beat
And I couldn't be Chuckie, Chuckie too petro
Chucky get scared, Chucky says, "Let's go"
If I was a Rugrat, it would of been so real
Me and my twin would've been just like Phil and Lil
[Verse 4: Blinky Blink]
Now with one wish, Blink grant you one trip
Where we going this adventure
Who you wanna come with?
See and you're my little brother that I'll come get
Run with, but it gotta be done quick
Though Chuckie is scared
And Tommy is sad
And Phil and Lil misses their mommy and dad
So pick a time and date
And find a place
And I guarantee you that we all get home safe

[Chorus: Mýa & Blackstreet]
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, let's go there
Take me to that great place
With wonders and wishes
Take me there, I wanna go there
Take me there, you know where
Just take me to that great place
With wonders and wishes2Embed
