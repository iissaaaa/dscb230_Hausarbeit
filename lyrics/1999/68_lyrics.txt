I do, I do
I do, I do
Mmm

[Verse 1]
All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world
All that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes
Shining at me
When you smile I can feel
All my passion unfolding

Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations
Seduce me 'cause I

[Chorus]
I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking, do I love you this much?
I do
Oh baby, oh
You might also like[Verse 2]
In my world before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
'Til that day I found you
How you opened my life
To a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all my heart
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I do cherish you (I'll cherish you, my baby)
(This much I know is true)
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
(I will always love you, baby, this much I promise you)
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking, do I love you this much?
Yes, I do
(I really love you, baby, I really love you, baby)
If you're asking, do I love you this much?
Baby, I do cherish you (I'll cherish you, my baby)
(This much I know is true)
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking, do I love you this much?
Baby, I do
[Outro]
Oh-oh, I do1Embed
