I wish that I could fly
Into the sky
So very high
Just like a dragonfly
I'd fly above the trees
Over the seas
In all degrees
To anywhere I please
Oh

[Chorus]
I want to get away
I wanna fly away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want to get away
I wanna fly away
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Let's go and see the stars
The Milky Way
Or even Mars
Where it could just be ours
Let's fade into the sun
Let your spirit fly
Where we are one
Just for a little fun
Oh, oh, oh yeah
