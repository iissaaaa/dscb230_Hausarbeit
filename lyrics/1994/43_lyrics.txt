Come to my window
Crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

[Verse 1]
I would dial the numbers
Just to listen to your breath
And I would stand inside my hell
And hold the hand of death
You don't know how far I'd go
To ease this precious ache
And you don't know how much I'd give
Or how much I can take

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh, to reach you
Oh

[Chorus]
Come to my window
Crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
You might also like[Verse 2]
Keeping my eyes open
I cannot afford to sleep
Giving away promises
I know that I can't keep
Nothing fills the blackness
That has seeped into my chest
I need you in my blood
I am forsaking all the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to reach you
Just to reach you
Oh, to reach you
Oh

[Chorus]
Come to my window
Crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon

[Bridge]
I don't care what they think
I don't care what they say
What do they know
About this love anyway?
[Pre-Chorus]
Come, come to my window
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'm coming home

[Chorus]
Come to my window
Oh, crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'm coming home

[Outro Chorus]
Come to my window
Oh, crawl inside
Wait by the light of the moon
Come to my window
I'll be home soon
I'll be home
I'll be home
I'll be homeEmbed
