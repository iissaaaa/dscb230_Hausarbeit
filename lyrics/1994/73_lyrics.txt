Open your eyes, I see
Your eyes are open
Wear no disguise for me
Come into the open

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's cold outside
Am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night
There will be no shame

[Chorus]
(Always) I wanna be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony
O love

(Always) I wanna be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony
O love

(Always)

[Verse 2]
Melting the ice for me
Jump into the ocean
Hold back the tide; I see
Your love in motion
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

And make believe with you

And live in harmony, harmony
O love

(Always) I wanna be with you (Always)
And make believe with you (Always)
And live in harmony, harmony
O love
