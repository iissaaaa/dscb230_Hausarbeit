She wear her long like Beyoncé but she look just like Solangé

[Chorus]
You only call me on the weekend
When you’re high and feeling low
I still answer the phone tho
Cos I’m lonely too and you know

[Verse 1]
Silly me I fell in love and you wasn’t looking to commit
I gotta say you played me well, I feel my ego took a hit
It was a fling and I fell in quick I’m never too proud to admit
But it is what is sometimes you win and sometimes you get what you give

Most of the time looks are deceiving, mama told me never judge a book
I thought it was you, one in a million but your motivations left me shook
I played a fool yeah I played a fool, your happiness at my expense
I gave you the keys you took em and threw em away
I swear this ain't making no sense

With your hair long like beyonce but she look just like Solange
You broke my heart last summer when you said you moving on
Dancing at the function you be with your girlfriends
When the lights come on that’s when you think about me
You might also like[PreChorus]
I know early sunday morning when I wake up you’ll be gone
I pick up all the pieces tell myself that I’ll move on
Your taste on my lips, it never goes away
But I’m starting to feel like these days

[Chorus]
You only call me on the weekend
When you’re high and feeling low
I still answer the phone tho
Cos I’m lonely too and you know

[Verse 2]
So tell me are you tired cos you been running my mind
Back and forth Aaliyah I can count a million miles
I still think about you sometimes and then you hit my line
Feelings they come back around and catch me by surprise
I been chasing dreams I put aside all the pillow talk
3 am you hit my phone and ask me can you pull up
I got a couple questions that’s still fucking with my mind
How you got a man and still my bed?
With your hair long like Beyonce but she look just like Solange
You broke my heart last summer baby I don’t need It nomore
Dancing at the function you be with your girlfriends
When the lights come on that’s when you
[Chorus]
You only call me on the weekend
When you’re high and feeling low
I still answer the phone tho
Cos I’m lonely too and you know

[Bridge]
But don’t it feel good you call someone to call when the lights come on where you at
You left me with a hangover that I can’t over and lately it feels like

[Chorus]
You only call me on the weekend
When you’re high and feeling low
I still answer the phone tho
Cos I’m lonely too and you know1Embed
