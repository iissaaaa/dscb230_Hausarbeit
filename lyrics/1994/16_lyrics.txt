No, I can't forget this evenin', or your face as you were leavin'
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

[Verse 2]
No, I can't forget tomorrow when I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

[Chorus]
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I can't forget this evenin' or your face as you were leavin'
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows
Yes, it's shows

[Chorus]
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

No, I can't live, no, I can't live
No, I, no, no, no, no, I
Can't live (No, I can't live) if living is without you (No, I can't live)
I can't live, I can't give anymore
Can't live (No, I can't live, no, I can't live)
No, no, I, no, no, no, no, I10Embed
