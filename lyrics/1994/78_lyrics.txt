There is nothing I wouldn't do for you
All that you want, I'll be all that you need
'Cause, boy, you know you've got me
And I'll do anything

Anything you wanna do, I am gonna try to
Boy, my body's just for you (Boy, my body's just for you)
Pleasure is the destination

All this love is for you
Anything you wanna do (You), I am gonna try to (It's alright)
Boy, my body's just for you (My body's just for you)
Pleasure is the destination (You can drive)
You can drive us if you choose to (If you choose to)
All my love's for you
Anything you wanna do (I'm yours), I am gonna try to (Baby)

You can drive us if you choose to (Love me, baby)
