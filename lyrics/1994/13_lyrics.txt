Mmmm, mmmm

[Verse 1]
Say good-bye
To not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember

[Verse 2]
Inside
I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside
I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

[Verse 3]
I learned
To let go
Of the illusion that we can possess
I learned
To let go
I travel in stillness

[Bridge]
And I'll remember happiness
I'll remember (I'll remember)
Mmmmm... (I'll remember)
Mmmmm...

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember
[Outro]
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)
No, â€‹I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why
I'll remember (I'll remember)Embed
