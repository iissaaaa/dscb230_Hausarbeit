Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, "We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind"

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, "If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm"
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, "It's time to go"
Doctor says, "The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And there he prayed:

[Chorus]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl
[Outro]
