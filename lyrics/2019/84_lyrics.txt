Oh, oh, oh
Drop a hundred of them thangs, spend a little on my baby
Lil' baby, lil' baby
Oh-oh
I just bought a pair of Rollies, got one for my baby
Lil baby, ooh, lil' baby, ooh

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Get out my car lonely, take care of the bar cover
Shawty got an ass so fat, she got a scarf over it
I got them rocks on me, used to have blocks on me
Now I'm living for PETA, cause I got a fox on me, ah
Now that I told you niggas, I showed you niggas
She come through this bitch with Chanel on her pumps
Apples in back of the trunk
You know I flex if I want, we gon' bust stops on the highway
I got my hands on her thighs
I play with her pussy and listen to Sade
Told her to bring it here shawty, told her to drop it there shawty
I'm from the belly of the beast, remember I barely used to eat
Now that my weed is so loud, you can hear it down the street
Pull up ten cars deep, you can't get rich off sleep

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, oh, oh
Drop a hundred of them thangs, spend a little on my baby
Lil' baby, lil' baby
Oh-oh
I just bought a pair of Rollies, got one for my baby
Lil' baby, ooh, lil' baby, ooh

I call her my lil' baby, she act like a lil' baby
She spoiled like it was the worst, she trip, I buy her the suitcases
We make the screw faces, had sex in a few places
Bedroom, living room, bathroom, kid's room and the basement
Straight shot, no chaser, you'll always be my lil' baby
Wanna know how your day been, can't wait to go bare skin
Stretch you out by the bear rug, give you hugs by the fireplace
Going down like the fire escape, estate with the iron gates
All the diamonds got a ping on 'em, living life like a king, don't I?
Walk around with your dream on me
Never front on your team homie
They say sex a weapon, shit, mine got a beam on it
My spinach got cream on it, Ty Dolla gon' sing on it

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, oh, oh
Drop a hundred of them thangs, spend a little on my baby
Lil' baby, lil' baby
Oh-oh
I just bought a pair of Rollies, got one for my baby
Lil' baby, oh-ohh, lil' baby, ooh

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Dolla $ign!
Lil' baby, lil' baby, ooh3Embed
