I've been up to my neck working six days a week
Wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
Been dreaming of gettin' away since I don't know
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico

[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, no shirt and no problems
No problems

[Verse 2]
Want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
Wanna look through my shades and see you there with me
Wanna soak up life for a while in laid back mode
No boss, no polite, no stress, no dress code

[Chorus]
No shoes, no shirt and no problems
Blues, what blues? Hey, I forgot 'em
The sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
And no shoes, and no shirt and no problems
Babe, let's get packed tank tops and flip-flops if you got 'em
No shoes, and no shirt and no problems
No problemsYou might also like1Embed
