Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking 'round with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
But every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"

[Verse 2: Chad Kroeger]
When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love-sick puppy chasing you around
Ooh, and it's alright
Bouncing 'round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If said I didn't like it, then you know I'd lied, ooh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"

[Bridge: Chad Kroeger]
Slowly, I begin to realize, this is never gonna end
Right about the same time you walk by
And I say, "Oh, here we go again, oh"

[Pre-Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
Every time I try to talk to you
I get tongue-tied
Turns out everything I say to you
Comes out wrong and never comes out right

[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"
[Chorus: Chad Kroeger]
So I'll say, "Why don't you and I get together
And take on the world and be together forever?
Heads we will, and tails we'll try again"
So I say, "Why don't you and I hold each other
And fly to the moon and straight on to heaven?
'Cause without you, they're never gonna let me in"4Embed
