Woo
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw Star Wars at least eight times
Had the Pac-Man pattern memorized
And I've seen the stuff they put inside
Stretch Armstrong, yeah
Oh, I was Roger Staubach in my backyard
Had a shoebox full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars on my arm
Well, I was a kid when Elvis died
And my mama cried

[Chorus]
It was 1970-something
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett hair-do days
Bell-bottoms and eight-track tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1970-something, yeah

[Verse 2]
It was the dawning of a new decade
We got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
My first love was Daisy Duke in them cut-off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried
You might also like[Chorus]
It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980-something

[Bridge]
Now I got a mortgage and an SUV
But all this responsibility
Makes me wish (Wish) sometimes (Sometimes)

[Chorus]
It was 1980-something
In the world that I grew up in
Skating rinks and black Trans Ams
Big hair and parachute pants
And lookin' back now I can see me
And oh, man, did I look cheesy
I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Oh, it was 1980-something

[Outro]
1970-something
Aw, it was 19-something4Embed
