Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1]
The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

[Pre-Chorus]
My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in
You might also like[Verse 2]
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Bridge]
I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out
[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah

Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah
(Beautiful girl)
(From my front porch looking in)Embed
