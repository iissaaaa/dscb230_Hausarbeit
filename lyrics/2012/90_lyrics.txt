[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy, are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where it starts, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, part
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound
Well, the sound is the key to my heart, heart

[Chorus]
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
We run, yes, we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-ni-ni
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
The, the, the, the, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Verse 2]
Feeling like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing past me, all over my skin, skin
I can't get enough, 'nough, 'nough
'Cause the beat keeps pulling me in, in
Taking me so high up, up
A place that I've never been, ahhh
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day, then do it again, 'gain

We run, yes, we run the night, the night
We run, yes, we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-ni-ni (The night)
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes we run the night, the night (We run, we run, run, we run, we run, run)
The, the, the, the, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!
Run 'em like, run 'em, run 'em, woop!

[Bridge]
Eh, eh, eh

Turn the lights down, down

Eh, eh, eh
Eh, eh, eh
Turn the lights down, down

[Chorus]
We run, yes, we run the night, the night (We run, we run)
We run, yes, we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-ni-ni (We run the night, the night)
We run, yes, we run the night
We, we, we run, we, we, we run, run
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
The, the, the, the1Embed
