Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins
Sippin’ on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine

(Chorus)
Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins

(Verse 1)
You broke my heart now i'm done with you
You broke my heart and made it into million pieces
Man I can’t deal with you no more
Get the fuckin' out my life now
Cause I can't deal with you no more, no more
Every time I think about you

(Chorus)
Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins

You broke my heart now i'm done with you
You broke my heart and made it into million pieces
Man I can't deal with you no more
Get the fuckin' out my life now
Cause I can't deal with you no more, no more
Every time I think about you

(Chorus)
Sippin’ on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins

(Verse 3)
You broke my heart now i’m done with you
You broke my heart and made it into million pieces
Man I can't deal with you no more
Get the fuckin’ out my life now
Cause I can't deal with you no more, no more
Every time I think about you1Embed
