When I'm done with thinking
Then I'm done with you
And when I'm done with crying
And then I'm done with you
When I feel so tired
Then I'm done with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know, everybody feels this way sometimes
Everybody feels this way

[Chorus]
And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I do

[Verse 2]
You're trying to convince me
That what I've done's not right
And I get so frustrated
I stay up every night
You ask me for an answer
And I'm so tired and I'm up in the air, I'm up in the air

[Pre-Chorus]
You know, everybody feels this way sometimes
Everybody feels this way
You might also like[Chorus]
And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way
Just because you say

[Bridge]
I will be ignored and I will be denied
And I could be erased, I could be brushed aside
And I will get scared and I will get shoved down
But I feel like I do because you push me around

[Verse 3]
I'm starting to ignore you (ignore you)
Now, I doubted you so long
I'm tired of over-thinking
I know you don't belong
Now, I'm asking questions
No one pushes me around

[Pre-Chorus]
You know, everybody feels this ways sometimes
Everybody feels this way

[Outro]
And I do
You can't hear it, but I do
You don't seem angry, but I do
I do (I do)
I do (I do)
I do (I do)
You don't seem angry, but I do
You don't hear it, but I do
I, I do
You can't hear it, but I do
I do (I do)
You don't seem angry, but I do
I do (I do)
You don't hear it, but I do1Embed
