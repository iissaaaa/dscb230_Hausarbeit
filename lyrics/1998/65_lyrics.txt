Well!

[Chorus]
Are you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Fay Wray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know?
Are you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Link Wray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Jimmy Ray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know?

[Verse 1]
Baby, can you tell when you look in my eye
You don't mess around with me
'Less you feelin' dangerous?
Are you into my scene? Lay it on the line
You come and take a walk with me
If you're feelin' dangerous
Because I'm meaner, I'm leaner
I ain't no in-betweener
With Aretha, I'm a dreamer
Good God, I'm a believer

[Chorus]
Are you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Fay Wray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know?
Are you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Link Wray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Jimmy Ray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know 'bout me?

Well, maybe we can shake it down by the walk
Do you think I'm takin' liberties?
Are you dangerous?
I've gotta let it out, it's somethin' in my genes
You come and take a walk with me
If you're feelin' dangerous
Because I'm meaner, I'm leaner
I ain't no in-betweener
With Aretha, I'm a dreamer
Good God, I'm a believer

[Chorus]
Are you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Fay Wray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know?
Are you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Link Wray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Jimmy Ray?
Who wants to know?
I said, who wants to know?
Who wants to know 'bout me?

[Bridge]
Everybody jump back, turn around now
Let's do it again
Everybody jump back, turn around now
Let's do it again
[Chorus]
Are you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Slim Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Fay Wray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know?
Are you Sting Ray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Link Wray? (Who wants to know?)
Are you Jimmy Ray?
Who wants to know? Who wants to know 'bout me?

[Chorus/Outro]

Who wants to know? Who wants to know 'bout me?
Are you Johnnie Ray? (Who wants to know?)
