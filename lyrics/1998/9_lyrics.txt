Usher's Hook

Young Ryan G's Verse :

Baby, i'm just tryna take it real nice and slow
But if you're cheating on me, then girl you gotta go
I went to McDonald's and said : Fam, let me get a salad to go
Squidward found a place where he can be all alone

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush

Spike or Spikey
Why these girls don't like me?
If you run up on me
Im'a hit you with the Swoosh like NikeYou might also likeEmbed
