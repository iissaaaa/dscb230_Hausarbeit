If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true

[Refrain]
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Chorus]
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think about myself

[Verse 2]
If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind

[Refrain]
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Violin Solo]

[Verse 1]
If I listened long enough to you

Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think about myself

Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think about myself, woo

[Chorus]
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think about myself

[Outro]
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody elseEmbed
