Well, tell me, do you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight?
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway, I've got no place to go
And you know, it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone

[Chorus]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone, but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy

[Verse 2]
You can trust me not to think
And not to sleep around
And if you don't expect too much from me
You might not be let down
'Cause all I really want is to be with you
Feeling like I matter too
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might be here with you
You might also like[Chorus]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone, but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone, but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy
Hey jealousy

[Verse 1]
Well, tell me if you think it'd be all right
If I could just crash here tonight
You can see I'm in no shape for driving
And anyway, I've got no place to go
And you know it might not be that bad
You were the best I'd ever had
If I hadn't blown the whole thing years ago
I might not be alone
[Chorus]
Tomorrow we can drive around this town
And let the cops chase us around
The past is gone, but something might be found
To take its place
Hey jealousy

[Outro]
Hey jealousy
She took my heart
Well, there's only one thing that I couldn't start7Embed
