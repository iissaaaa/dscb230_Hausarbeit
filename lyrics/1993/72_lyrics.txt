I, I can't read the future
But I still wanna hold you close
Right now, I need that from you
So give me the morning
Sharing another day with you
Is all I want to know

[Chorus]
And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

[Verse 2]
And I, I didn't wanna tell you
Things I didn't wanna know myself
I was afraid to show
But you, you gave me a reason
A reason to face the truth, oh yes you did
To face the truth, face the truth
Face the truth

[Chorus]
And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, you shine like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go
You might also like[Bridge]
Won't let me go, let go of my heart

[Chorus]
And baby I, I've tried to forget you
But the light of your eyes
Still shines, like an angel
A spirit that won't let me go

[Outro]
You know
Won't let me go1Embed
