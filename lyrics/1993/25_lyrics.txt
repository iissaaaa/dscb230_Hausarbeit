Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
Ooh, it's a passion
Ooh, you can feel it in the air
Ooh, it's a passion, ooh

[Chorus: Thea Austin]
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

[Post-Chorus: Thea Austin]
Ooh, it's a passion
Ooh, you can feel it in the air
Ooh, it's a passion, ooh

Rhythm
You can feel it (You can feel it)
Rhythm
Rhythm is a dancer
Rhythm
You can feel it (You can feel it)

Rhythm is a dancer

[Verse: Turbo B]
Let the rhythm ride
You guide you sneak inside
You set your mind to
Move to its pulsation
Bass vibrations, synth sensation
Pause is not a place in mind
And body must be free to
Please take it all in
Nothing to lose everything to
Win, but it controls you
Holds you, molds you
Not the older
New touch it taste it free
Your soul and let it face you
Got to be what you wanna
If the groove don't get you the rifle's gonna
I'm serious as cancer
When I say rhythm is a dancer
[Chorus: Thea Austin]
Rhythm is a dancer
It's a soul's companion
You can feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air1Embed
