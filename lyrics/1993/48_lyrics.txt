In the daytime, I just dream
Stuck in my head 'till I burst out the seams
Higher than mountains, soar like a falcon
Came for you pigeons, get stuck in my talons
Don't need rewards, don't need a medallion
Gimme a bag that's full of that powder
Wait, I made this song in the shower
Musically ruling it, this is my power
Top of the tower, Miles Prower
Moving too fast, blow through these cowards
Gimme my tooth back, that was too sour
I save the princess, they call me Bowser
Okay, turn this shit up, let's get louder
Too many combos, they don't got a counter
Ooo, okay, 180 rotate
Spark it like sulfate, Solo got no face
Solo the ghost, I'll go out like Cobain
Making sure every track hotter than Moltres
I got my family back like All State
Making these niggas turn back, leave my state
All of yo' data corrupt, no save state
Fail safe, don't leave this shit up to luck
I make it, I made it, I'm willing, I kill it
Popular artist, I just spit my feelings
Uncapped potential, yo' head hit the ceiling
Industry claws won't involve me
These villains on me, I hear 'em talking
Zombies moaning, grab the revolver, uh
Shot to my brain, leave me drained like a faucet
Unlimited power like my first name Austin
Shot after shot, till I'm stuck in a coffin
I need this music shit, can't do an office
9 to 5 grind with a boss who be hoggin'
That green that be stuck in the company coffers
Give me an offer, I'm making 'em want it
Get me on tours, foot through the door
Shove it, trapped in my mind
In a prison of nothing, all of these rappers be bluffing
Gimme a beat, I turn that shit to stuffing
Food on my plate, leave me stuffed and rambunctious
Gotta be tough just to get through the suffering
Solo the demon, I'm puffing and huffing
Blowing down houses, ride with the ruffians
32 deep, that's your girl, well, I'm cuffing her
Take her to comforters, shit
You might also like[Bridge: Solo]
You can't tell me that it's nothing
I work hard and I'm honest
Not concerned if I'm balling
Want the world in my palms and
Sometimes life is exhausting
Can't take breaks, they're not often
So play this song while you riding
Want this shit to be timeless

[Verse 2: Solo]
In the daytime, I just dream
Stuck in my head as long it seems
Could've been two years, could've been weeks
Can't take vacations cause I gotta eat
Remember when we were still stuck on the street
Reside in my mind, no blankets to sleep in
These words are movies, this is the screening
We got a purpose, I'm giving it meaning
Hotter than the summer season
Hope you get stuck on this song like adhesives
Colder than anything tucked in the freezer
If they don't support it then make 'em believers
Mmm, pardon my cold (Cole), Keisha
Solo the fool, gotta split like amoeba
I'm riding around in a 2000's Prius
Ain't flexing or stressing about how they see me
Uh, you got a Beamer
You got two kids but can't feed 'em
I'm blind to the bullshit, fuckery's feasible
Evil Kenevil, ride through above three of you
Triplets, no Beetlejuice at my own funeral
Could never ever get stuck in a cubicle
Solo Maleficent, magical principles
Fridays with Freddy, RIP through all the villagers
In other words, yes, I am killing them
I can't decide if I wanna be serious
Is it a pipe dream? Am I delirious?
Does she despise me? I'm really feeling her
I had to write this shit when I was feeling numb
Slave to my brain, shackles torn got me wrinkled up
Spreading my influence, Solo the sprinkler
This an original, X had to finish 'emEmbed
