The road I have traveled on
Is paved with good intentions
It's littered with broken dreams
That never quite came true

[Verse 2]
When all of my hopes were dyin'
Her love kept me tryin'
But she does her best to hide
The pain that she's been through

[Chorus]
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fears she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

[Verse 3]
She's always been there for me
Whenever I've fallen
When nobody else believes
She'll be there by my side
You might also like[Verse 4]
I don't know how she takes it
Just once, I'd like to make it
Then there'll be tears of joy
That fill her lovin' eyes

[Chorus]
When she cries at night
And she doesn't think that I can hear her
She tries to hide
All the fear she feels inside
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she cries

[Chorus]
So I pray this time
I can be the man that she deserves
'Cause I die a little each time
When she criesEmbed
