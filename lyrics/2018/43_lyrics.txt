I'm three high, I mean tree high
Man I'm smoking that weed like it's prescribed
And these niggas can't touch me like beehives
And you niggas hella backwards like rewind
And my girl hella bad and got behind
I just jump on that thang until she recline
And I run through a party like a track for some racks
If my niggas going down then I'm picking up the slack
Money money money on my mizee
When a nigga kicking it you bet I'm still steezy
I get some [?] light a bleezy
I never met a bitch that could keep me

[Hook: Kool John]
I shut that bitch down yes I did that
And I came up from nothing I did that
Fit 4 hoes in the 2 door I did that
Throw an eighth in that blunt yeah I did that
Yes I did that, Yes I did that
Yes I shut that bitch down yes I did that
And I came up from nothing I did that
Fit 4 hoes in the 2 door I did that

[Verse 2: Young Bari]
I swear it's hard out here for a real one
It's even harder when you really wanna kill them
I tell them I ain't got no choice
I just sit back and let the action be the noise
Baby said she love my voice
Every time I'm in the area you always getting moist
Wanna know my whereabouts she ain't even gotta point
She remind me of the pig so I call her oink-oink
I don't really like people in my business
Unless they talking about business
I walk it talk it man I really live that
If I don't talk about it then it mean I did that
