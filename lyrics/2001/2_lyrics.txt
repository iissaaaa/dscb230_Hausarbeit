I keep on fallin' in
And outta love with you
Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, at times I feel used
Lovin' you, darlin', makes me so confused

[Chorus]
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure
And cause me so much pain? (Yeah, yeah)
Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

[Chorus]
I keep on fallin' in and out
Of love with you
I never loved someone (Oh, someone)
The way that I'm lovin' you (Way I, uh, uh)

I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall, fall, fall (Sing)
Fall

[Chorus]
I keep on fallin' in and out (Out)
Of love with you (Love with you)
I never loved someone (I never, loved)
The way that I'm lovin' you (Oh)
I'm fallin' in and out (Yeah)
Of love with you (Of love with you)
I never loved someone (No, no, no)
The way that I'm lovin' you (Uh)
I'm fallin' in and out (Yeah)
Of love with you (Of love with you)
I never loved someone (No, no, no)
The way that I'm lovin' you (Uh)
