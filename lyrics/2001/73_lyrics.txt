He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say "I love you" one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughin' in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
He said, "Daddy, when you coming home?"
He said the first thing that came to his mind

[Chorus 1]
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh, I'm already there

[Verse 2]
She got back on the phone
Said, "I really miss you, darling
Don't worry about the kids, they'll be alright"
Wish I was in your arms
Lyin' right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes
You might also like[Chorus 2]
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there 'til the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh, I'm already there

[Bridge]
We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

[Chorus 3]
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there 'til the end
Can you feel the love that we share?
Oh, I'm already there

[Outro]
Oh, I'm already
There8Embed
