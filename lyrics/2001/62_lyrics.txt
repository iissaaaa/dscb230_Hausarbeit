I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head
I'm checkin' your clothes
And you wear the same size shoe
You sleep in his spot
And you're driving his car
But I don't know just who you are

[Chorus 1]
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure who you are
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses
Goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk
They would have nothing to tell
So what could it be?
Is there someone imitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
Look me in the face
And tell me that I'm wrong
When I say
You might also like[Chorus 2]
There's a stranger in my house (There's a stranger in my house)
It took a while to figure out (It took a while to figure out)
There's no way you could be who you say you are (Ooooh)
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that (Touch me like that)
And he wouldn't treat me like you do (Treat me like you do)
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me (Ooooh)
So I'm convinced there's a
Stranger in my house

[Bridge]
Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me
Have I changed so drastically?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the same

[Chorus 3]
(There's a stranger in my house)
(It took a while to figure out) It took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are (Ooooh)
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that (Touch me like that)
And he wouldn't treat me like you do (Treat me like you do)
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me (Ooooh)
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house (Stranger in my house)
Woo!
(There's a stranger in my house)
(It took a while to figure out) Took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are (Ooooh)
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that (Touch me like that)
And he wouldn't treat me like you do (Treat me like you do)
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me (Ooooh)
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house (Stranger in my house)
[Outro]
