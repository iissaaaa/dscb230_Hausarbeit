Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
If I let my nigga 21 tell it, you a
Pussy

[Verse: 21 Savage]
Spin a block twice like it ain't nowhere to park (21)
Smack the backside of his head like he Bart (Pussy)
OVO 4L, we come out when it get dark (21, 21)
Big stepper, he came in a Rolls, but he left in a stretcher (21)
Let my brother drive while I shoot, team effort (21)
Askin' all these questions, bitch, you must think you Nadeska
Thе chopper like to feel on all the opps, it's a molеster (21)
I be with my gun like Rozay be with lemon pepper
She wanna hear some Afrobeats 'cause she just popped a Tesla
All that workin' out, that nigga must think he a wrestler
But this ain't UFC, this chopper came with a compressor (21)
This chopper came with a compressor (Pussy)
This chopper came with a— (Pussy)
This Glock 45 came with a switch (21)
If I was Will Smith, I would've slapped him with a stick
Put your hands in the air, it's a stick-up (21)
Spin the same hood where I get my dick sucked (Facts)
If you standin' on business, put your blick up (21, 21)
Come around actin' scary, get your shit took (21)
Fell in love with feelin' dizzy, so I spizzin (21)
I got mad love for the boy, yeah, that's my twizzin (21)
If them niggas keep on dissin', slide agaizzin (21)
We the reason why the opps ain't got no frizziends (21)
Last nigga played with me got turned duppy
I ain't even roll him in the 'Wood 'cause he musty
You ask how she doin', I just tell her come and fuck me
Shot his ass twenty times, damn, this nigga lucky (Damn, that nigga lucky)

Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin'

[Outro: Drake]
Say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin', say somethin'
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayyEmbed
