Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where they strung up a man they say who murdered three

[Refrain]
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 2]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where a dead man called out for his love to flee

[Refrain]
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 3]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run so we'd both be free

[Refrain]
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree

[Verse 4]
Are you, are you coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of hope side by side with me
