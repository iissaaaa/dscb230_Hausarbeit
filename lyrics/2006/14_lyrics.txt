OH SHIT!
Oh Shit!
Oh Shit
Oh shit
[Chorus]
Niggas rushin, they pushin to the dance floor
Bitches twerking wit reckless abandon
Drop it low, wine slow, get ratchet
Throw ass to whoever’s catching
Niggas runnin they gunnin for the dance floor
All hands on deck when my shit on
It’s hot, No thoughts, Basic Instinct
Buss it wide, don’t care who sees me
[VERSE 1]
Sweat drips. Drips wet
From my head, down my neck, to my chest
Flesh pressed onto my flesh
I’m flexin OG Bitch you Guessed
Don’t breath. No rest
All eyes on me obsessed
Call it relievin stress
Walk up Grab mе Say Less
[Chorus 2]
Niggas rushin, they pushin to the dancе floor
Bitches twerking wit reckless abandon
Dip it low, pick it up slow, get nasty
Pretend it’s just Me and U like Cassie
Niggas runnin, they gunnin for the dance floor
All hands on deck when my shit on
I bet you can get me bodied
I’m Beyonce tonight I’m bein naughty
[VERSE 2]
Release. Detach
Feral urges in me clash
On the floor like I’m doin this for cash
Oh shit I’m un-a-bashed
I heave. I thrash
Roll back. Throw ass
Now that shit’s movin fast
Oh shit I almost made it clap
[BRIDGE]
(Oh Shit!) Almost took ur man
(Oh Shit!) He wants to feel it in his hands
(Oh Shit!) He can feel it in his pants
Shutup bitch I don’t want your man
(Oh Shit!) Almost took ur man
(Oh Shit!) A flirtation began
(Oh Shit!) Hips don’t lie true romance
Shutup bitch come get ur mans
TWO NIGGAS WRAPPED ROUND MY HIPS (Oh Shit)
AND BOTH THEY WRISTS MATCH MY DRIP (I insist)
TWO BITCHES SLUTTIN OUT LOCKIN LIPS (Kiss kiss)
AND BOTH THEY NIGGAS DON’T TRIP (Oh Shit)
TWO NIGGAS WRAPPED ROUND MY HIPS (Oh Shit)
AND BOTH THEY WRISTS MATCH MY DRIP (I insist)
TWO BITCHES SLUTTIN OUT LOCKIN LIPS (Kiss kiss)
AND BOTH THEY NIGGAS DON’T TRIP (Oh Shit)
[VERSE 3]
Push. Smash
Reach. Trance
Strange hands. Command
I do what the beat demands
Movin in sync, boy band
Movements divinely planned
Moves nasty should be banned
Oh shit I should get paid to dance
[BREAKDOWN]
OH SHIT! I SHOULD GET PAID TO DANCE
Oh shit I should get paid to
I dip Do the splits Ride the ground toot my shit
Get back up I’m too lit Get back down Stay too lit
You see it, I’m that bitch, Extra, Lickin My Lips
I can’t stop, No Veto, Ride this beat, Rodeo
Peep Show. On Go
Ya’ll Should Throw Dough
Grind Slow. Scrub Floor
I should Go Pro
Oh Shit I might quit
Y’all should be throwin bands
Oh Shit I might quit
I should get paid to dance
[BRIDGE]
(Oh Shit!) I should get paid to dance
(Oh Shit!) But I don’t do it for the bands
(Oh Shit!) It’s like I’m made to dance
(Oh Shit!) I just run it up cos I can
(Oh Shit!) Here goes ur man
(Oh Shit!) Tired that nigga out like the xans
(Oh Shit!) Now I can feel it in his pants
