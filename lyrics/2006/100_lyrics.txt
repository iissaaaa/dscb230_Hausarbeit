Alright, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be
Nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair 'round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

[Verse 2]
Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water-bed
Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camouflage, I wanna be exposed
And not be afraid to fall

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon
Yeah, I would
And shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah
That's what I'd do
That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
You always want what you can't have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you I willEmbed
