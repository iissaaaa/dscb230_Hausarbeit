There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were actin' so strange, mmm
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

[Pre-Chorus 1: Justin with All]
Was it somethin' I said
To make you turn away?
To make you walk out and leave me cold?
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

[Chorus: All & Justin]
I've been sittin' here
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face (Touch your face)
But the truth remains, you're

Gone
You're gone
Baby, you're gone
Girl, you're gone
Baby girl, you're gone
You're gone
You're

[Verse 2: Justin with All]
Now, I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone
No, no
But if there's somethin' that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passin' so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day, yeah (You)
But baby, I don't want to

[Pre-Chorus 2: Justin with All]
So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
(Take my mind off missing you)
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me, too
Please say you do
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, yeah
[Chorus: All & Justin]
I've been sittin' here (Sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man and be strong)
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face
(Wishin' I could touch your face)
But the truth remains, you're
(Truth remains, you're)

[Post-Chorus: Justin & All]
Gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
You're gone
Oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin with All]
What will I do
If I can't be with you?
Tell me where will I turn to?
Baby, who will I be?
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart?
Baby, why don't you see
That I need you here with me?
Oh, oh
[Chorus: All & Justin]
I've been sittin' here (Sittin' here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man)
I drove myself insane
Wishin' I could touch your face
(Goin' crazy, baby, oh, oh)
But the truth remains
(The truth remains you're gone)
I've been sittin' here (Sitting here)
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
(My best to be a man)
I drove myself insane (Oh, oh, oh)
Wishin' I could touch your face
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
But the truth remains, you're
(Baby, the truth is you're)

[Post-Chorus: Justin & All]
Gone
You're gone
You're... gone
You're gone
Baby girl, you're gone
You're gone

[Outro: All]
But the truth remains, you're7Embed
