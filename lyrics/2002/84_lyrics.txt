Good morning beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I opened my eyes
And see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day

[Bridge]
I couldn't see the light
I didn't know day from night
I had no reason to care
Well since you came along
I can face the dawn
Cause I know you'll be there

[Chorus]
Good morning beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I opened my eyes
And see your sweet face
Its a
Good morning beautiful day
You might also like[Bridge]
I never worry
If it's raining outside
Cause in here with you girl
The sun always shines

[Chorus]
Good morning beautiful
How was your night?
Mine was wonderful
With you by my side
And when I opened my eyes
And see your sweet face
Its a good morning beautiful day-ay

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, good morning beautiful
Day

[Outro]
Mmm
(Good morning beautiful)
It's a beautiful day
(Good morning beautiful)
Good morning
(Good morning beautiful)
What a beautiful day
