You and I got something
But it's all and then it's nothing to me, yeah
And I got my defenses
When it comes through your intentions for me, yeah
And we wake up in the breakdown
With the things we never thought we could be, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you darling
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

[Chorus]
And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

[Verse 2]
I am no solution
To the sound of this pollution in me, yeah
And I was not the answer
So forget you ever thought it was me, yeah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the one who broke you
I'm not the one you should fear
We got to move you darling
I thought I lost you somewhere
But you were never really ever there at all

[Chorus]
And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone

[Bridge]
And I don't need the fallout
Of all the past that's in between us
And I'm not holding on
And all your lies weren't enough to keep me here

[Chorus]
And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
And I wanted to be
All you need
Somehow here is gone
[Outro]
And I want to get free
Talk to me
I can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
And I can feel you falling
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah
I know it's out there
I know it's out there
Somehow here is gone, yeah1Embed
