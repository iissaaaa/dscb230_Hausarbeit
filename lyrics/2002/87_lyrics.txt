Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
Trying to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here  to the twilight
There's a dead end to my left, there's a burning bush to my right
You aren't in sight
You aren't in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you want me
Like I want you?

[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

[Verse 2]
Mothers on the stoop, boys in souped-up coupes on this hot summer night
Between fight and flight, is the blind man's sight and a choice that's right
I roll the window down, feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town
Feel broken down, ah
I feel broken down
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Do you need me
Like I need you?

[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?

[Bridge]
Sweet sorrow—he said, "Call tomorrow"
Sweet sorrow—he said, "Call tomorrow"

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love me
Like I love you?

[Chorus]
Or am I standing still
Beneath a darkened sky?
Or am I standing still
With the scenery flying by?
Or am I standing still?
Out of the corner of my eye
Was that you passing me by?
[Outro]
Are you passing me by?
Passing me by
(Do you want me?)
Passing me by
Do you need me like I need you too?
(Passing me by)
Do you want me like I want you
(Passing me by)
Or are you passing me by?
Or am I standing still?1Embed
