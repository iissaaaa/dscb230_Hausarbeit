He was a six-foot stallion
Say, a storybook thug
He was the kind that made you wonder
How he put down the love
He had a hanky in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart start palpitatin'
Every time he came near (I do!!)
He got a spankin' new Range
For that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin'
He was plaided
And his hair was cornrowed
He had his wrists bling-blingin'
And his long legs was bowed
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go

[Chorus]
I do!!
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
I do!!

Me and my crew started groovin'
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show
I shook my hips, took a dip
And rolled my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance with me
I felt fingertips (I do!!)
On the small of my back
So I had to react
Like I was playin' hard to get
And told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you for sure

[Chorus]
I do!!
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
I do!!
[Bridge]
Watch me drop, drop
Shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips
As I dip and roll
And watch me stop, stop traffic
As I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papis want me
But all I want is you (I do!!)
Watch me drop, drop
Shake it for the fellas who know
Watch me pop, pop my hips
As I dip and roll
And watch me stop, stop traffic
As I walk through the room
Knowin' all the papis want me
But all I want is you

[Chorus]
I do!!
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
'Cause I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out player
Ballin' out of control
I do!!2Embed
