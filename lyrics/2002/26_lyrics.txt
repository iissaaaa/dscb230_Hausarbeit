I don't want to see you waiting
I've already gone too far away
I still can't keep the day from ending
No more messed-up reasons for me to stay

[Chorus]
Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all again
Whoa-oh, again

[Verse 2]
Months went by with us pretending
When did our light turn from green to red?
I took a chance and left you standing
Lost the will to do this once again

[Chorus]
Well this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time again
Whoa-oh, again

[Bridge]
I see you waiting
Look so lonely
I see you waiting
I see you waiting

[Chorus]
Well, this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my, oh
Well, this is not for real, afraid to feel
I just hit the floor, don't ask for more
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time
You can't stop the feeling, there is no reason
Just make the call and take it all again
Whoa-oh, again4Embed
