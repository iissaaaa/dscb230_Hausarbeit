I got a feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling, woo-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling, woo-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (A feel-)

[Post-Chorus: will.i.am & Fergie, will.i.am]
Tonight's the night
Let's live it up
I got my money
Let's spend it up (I feel-)
Go out and smash it
Like oh my God
Jump off that sofa
Let's kick it off (I feel-)

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out
And losin' all control (I feel-)

[Refrain: will.i.am, Fergie]
Fill up my cup
Mazel tov
Look at her dancin'
Just take it off (I feel-)
Let's paint the town
We'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again (I feel-)
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it, and do it, let's live it up
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

[Chorus: will.i.am, will.i.am & Fergie]
'Cause I got a feeling, woo-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling, woo-hoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (A feel-)

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Here we come, here we go
We gotta rock
Easy come, easy go
Now we on top
Fill the shot, body rock
Rock it, don't stop
Round and round, up and down
Around the clock

[Bridge: will.i.am & Fergie]

Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (Do it)
Get, get, get, get with us
You know what we say
Party every day
P-p-p-party every day
