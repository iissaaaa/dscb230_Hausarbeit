Zone Four, yeah, let's go
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
I'll be swimmin' in women and I'll be diggin' in linen
And I'll be whippin' the whips that you never seen of (Seen of)
Well the quip is just whip it and make it purr like a kitten
And I'ma have you addi-i-icted to me now (Me now)
And all the fast girls wanna get money (Yeah)
Baby girl, you ain't gettin' nothin' from me (Woo)
All you get is this ****
Make it bounce like a bunny (Come on)
Ki-Ki-Ki-Kicks are for kids but you feel it in your ribs like
Wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker (Yeah)
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait (Breezy, go)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, I wanna make you sing like opera
Gotta cold, hit a dose, I'm your doctor
Handcuffs like a copper, helicopter, chopper
Lion King in that thing, Mufasa (Whoops)
I'ma break you off just a bigger bit of me
You might wanna take a bite right out of me
Girl, I think you ready, oh, damn
You want me to do something, yes, ma'am
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
I just wanna get a little, give a little, take a little
Make a little love all over my place
Baby girl, you got a bottom, I can spot it from a mile
And I be wildin' out, then I'll pass you off to Trey (Yeah)
Girl, I'm right in front of you, wanna be right up under you
Kissing under your belly button for about a month or two
You gon' love it when I look in your eyes
I'm hitting high now

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
I'll be swimmin' in women and I'll be diggin' in linen
And I'll be whippin' the whips that you never seen of (Seen of)
Well the quip is just whip it and make it purr like a kitten
And I'ma have you addi-i-icted to me now (Me now)
And all the fast girls wanna get money (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Girl, I like you face down with your *** up
Do the most, get ghost like Casper
Beat it like a boxer, eat it like a lobster
Tell me your desires, get you higher than a Rasta
I got something special for you when I get you home
You should let me drive, girl, the ride's really long
If you wanna ride, ride, ride, you can
You just gotta lie, lie to your man

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
I just wanna get a little, give a little, take a little
Make a little love all over my crib
And, girl, if you can take a lot, make a lot of sounds
I'ma take your body down and I'll pass you on to Chris (Woo)
Girl, I'm right in front of you, tell me what you wanna do
I just want your body with my body right up under you
You turning me on like a Keri Hilson song
And I wanna get you going right now, let me knock you down

[Chorus: Chris Brown, The Game]
Wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker (Uh)
W-W-W-W-Wait
[Verse 3: The Game, Trey Songz]
I'm in that Murcielago, ridin' through Chicago
And it's 12 o'clock, 12 o'clock on my Movado
Yeah, I know, me and CB, it's like back to back Diablos
Drop the top, put on your goggles
Swim with the young Mike Phelps under my Gucci belt
I said swim, not unstrap my Gucci belt
More choppers than Johnny Depp and the mobsters
So many Game imposters ridin' ram in the boxsters
I'm in DeVille
Sippin' on Belvedere vodka, so many tricks
Hit 'em in a little bit, can't rap my ish
I ain't no chicken, ish never been no tricky ish
If I buy a bottle, she a model when she lickin' it
If I'm goin' down, I'm eatin' it like quick and split
Knockin' on my dressin' room just to get flick with Chris
She spillin' my Cris', freakin' on my fresh fit (Ayy)
Curve, that's when I get on to the next chick (Ayy)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
I'll be swimmin' in women and I'll be diggin' in linen
And I'll be whippin' the whips that you never seen of (Seen of)
Well the quip is just whip it and make it purr like a kitten
And I'ma have you addi-i-icted to me now (Me now)
And all the fast girls wanna get money (Yeah)
Baby girl, you ain't gettin' nothin' from me (Woo)
All you get is this ****
Make it bounce like a bunny (Come on)
Ki-Ki-Ki-Kicks are for kids but you feel it in your ribs like
Wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
W-W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait8Embed
