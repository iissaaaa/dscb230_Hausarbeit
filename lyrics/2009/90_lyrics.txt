I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists
But I run too late
I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow, it seems

[Pre-Chorus]
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

[Chorus]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

[Verse 2]
We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

[Chorus]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

[Interlude: Charles & Hillary]
Woah-woah
Oh, I run to you

[Chorus]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts comin' undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to

[Outro: Charles & Hillary]
I run to you, I run to you, yeah
Woah-woah
Oh, I run to you
I run to you, girl
Woah-woah
I always run to you
Run to you
Run to you7Embed
