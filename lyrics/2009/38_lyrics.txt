I don't wanna be the girl that laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning
'Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

[Chorus]
I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
Why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're my protection
But how do I feel this good sober?

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation (I know we did)
'Cause I won't remember, save your breath 'cause what's the use? (Ooh)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly, "Come and play"
I, I am falling
And if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame

[Chorus]
I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh, whoa, whoa)
No pain inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
I'm looking for myself sober
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself sober

[Bridge]
When it's good then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad
'Til you're tryin' to find the you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, never again
Broken down in agony and just tryin' to find a friend
Oh
Oh
[Chorus]
I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)
But why do I feel this party's over? (But why do I feel this party's over?)
No pain (No) inside (No)
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)
I'm safe up high (Nothing)
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over? (Over)
No pain inside
You're like perfection
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)15Embed
